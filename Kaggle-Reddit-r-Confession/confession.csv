I had a Sandals Resort about 2 miles down the road from my workplace.  Every weekend I would go to the resort and eat and drink for free.  I didn’t have to sneak in, I just walked right in from the public beach that was in front of the resort.  If I remember correctly there were 6 entrances to the resort off the beach, all of which were manned by security.  I’d walk by the 6 entrances looking for a security guard that seemed a little distracted (which was super easy) and then walk right in.  I confirmed well before hand that this Sandals did not use wristbands to ID guests.  I remember at least once the security guard asked me which room I was in, somehow I convinced her my room key and wallet were with my wife at the swimming pool inside and she let me in.

The funny thing about all this is that Sandals is a couples resort, and I was single at the time - in fact I wonder how they never caught me because here’s this single guy, by himself, showing up at this resort week after week for almost a year eating and drinking for free and using their pools and sauna’s and nobody caught on.  

Just to clarify, I did not have access any rooms there.  I was using their restaurants, bars, pools, saunas, work out rooms etc.",2022-12-18 14:54:41
Was pushy with a girl 2 yrs ago and i cant get over it,64,zou8aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/zou8aa/was_pushy_with_a_girl_2_yrs_ago_and_i_cant_get/,31,1671353708.0,"

When I was 16-17M I had a drinking problem. I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. 

2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. And I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn’t get aggressive or violent when rejected. When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. She told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience.It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven’t done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. 
Although im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go",2022-12-18 10:55:08

My friend and I went out drinking and she ended up getting sick. and to add a cherry on top, she started her period completely out of no where. it was a determination to get her at least a small pack of tampons from ANYWHERE. I went to 711 that is about 2 seconds away from my home and noticed a 16 pack tampon was $17.99. The brand was playtex. In my mind I found this absolutely outrageous because of all of the added chemicals to this brand and decided I was going to sneak (STEAL) a few. i shove about 6 in my jacket,
 of course originally I looked over at the store attending and saw him down on his phone not paying attention so I thought a few tampax out of this box won't hurt them??  especially when these run for $8 at CVS. I usually try not to steal bc of past experiences (stole at ages or 6(caught) 13, 15 got away with BUT the guilt got to me each time. the biggest one was a $200 transaction I rigged when I was about 18 at a job I hated and THANKFULLY  i didn't get any charges pressed . I thought learned what that feeling was like but I don't know what got into me. I felt like I didn't really need to many and other options were not available. A very kind, honestly older lady comes out of no where and  silently Holds out her hand. Does not say one word just wants it back. I felt so bad I  offered to pay for the box because of how embarrassing it was getting caught but a deep down part of me feels extremely distraught because this is not who I thought I was after all the therapy my parents had put me in. im an adult now and continue to make these decisions. I wish I didn't make this decision and don't know why I did it. I really also WISH I didn't do it so close to my house because my boyfriend goes there a lot and sometimes I accompany him. now I have to admit that my 21 year old self is stealing TAMPONS just because I didn't want to pay an over priced box. why must I be so cheap reddit?????",2022-12-17 13:48:10

TLDR; I stole someone’s AirPods and I need to confess

Earlier today while I was in my study hall I noticed a pair of AirPods underneath my chair. I opened them and hit the “pair” button to see who they belonged to. I saw no name on them, so I had no idea where to begin looking for a owner. I looked around to see if anyone was searching for anything, and saw nothing. I put them in my bag and kept em. I didn’t pair them to my phone to see if someone would use the tracker on their “find my ___” app for apple phones. No one approached me and no one has been looking for AirPods that I have seen. I don’t have AirPods or earbuds if my own since someone stole mine about a month ago (these weren’t mine, I wrote my name on one of those stickers you can write on and slapped that onto the earbuds) so unless someone approached me I wanted to pair them to my phone. Once I got home I still have the AirPods and am racked with guilt for stealing someone’s property.

They were on sale and I made a dumb, expensive purchase. I live in a beautiful place and have been working too much over the years, thought a new bike would get me out of the house more. The package kept getting delayed and then it finally came!! We put it together and I went out for a test ride. Already had my helmet and other accessories. I have been on motorcycles before but have never driven anything myself with throttle, so that was new to me. I did great riding around my neighborhood until I was making a turn and turned too fast and went right into the side of a car. I managed to turn just enough that just my handle bar scraped the side, left a big black streak. I was unsure at the time if there was a dent as well or just a streak that might luckily come right off. I stood there for a very long time, hoping someone would come out so I could sort it out right then and there, but no one came. I didn't have anything on me to leave a note, so I decided to ride home, make a note really quick, and ride back and put it on the windshield. It was the right thing to do, and I would be furious if someone hit my car and didn't do anything about it! So I went back with my note and the car was gone. I didn't see it again, I purposefully drove past multiple times a day for a week or so after that happened and the car was never there. I started to think I guess they were unlucky friendly visitors to whichever neighbor's house and I won't ever know who was there or who their friends might be. So I started to forget about it feeling in my heart that I tried to do the right thing. However, I have seen the car there again, since. And I have not owned up. Part of it is I haven't had any savings since something totally screwed up happened to my SO and I that shouldn't have and I had to empty my bank account to fix it, and I put the stupid bike on a credit card. And it's been so long now, and the car is usually parked in front of some shady apartments, I'm a huge wuss, and I'm afraid of the backlash after this long.

In that moment I knew I was making impact. Time slowed down as I braced and lead with my shoulder into the ass end of this person's car.

The impact wasn't that bad. I hit my shoulder and bounced right back off it. I walked up the window and said ""wtf did you stop for, I was behind you"" I attempt to shift the blame but I knew I was pretty much at fault.

They came out and demanded money and to see my ID. It was an old man and his old wife.

I said ""Not happening"" and hopped on my bike and sped off into a side road and didn't look back.

I stopped in a small secluded area not to far from the scene and contemplated going back.

I kept thinking ""shit shit shit the cops are going to start checking all the cameras in the area just to get this old man some footage of me so I can pay damage costs etc etc""

A week went by, then two, and then a whole year. Nothings happened and I intend on never riding a bike through that area again, or just in general. I don't feel like being roadkill either.

I got out of there as fast as I could. Now I'm worried as fuck. I'm worried that actual Lisa will see that someone (me) returned her item and got cash back.  I'm kicking myself for not wearing a mask into the store; they saw my face. 

I should've just returned it to the store and they could've contacted Lisa that she lost her item. I didn't know that the receipt was connected to an account because it didn't have any name or information on the paper whatsoever, only that someone paid in cash. That's why I thought I'd be fine to return it and be scot-free. 

Am I going to get into trouble? How deep in shit am I reddit?",2022-12-12 02:21:57

That made me felt  even more guilt. She asked the security guard  to check the camera. It was clearly me. She asked me once again but  i refused to speak. she keep asking, desperate for an answer from me, and ended up crying. i said nothing and just casually walked away. I didn't see her ever since.

In high school I destroyed what would be ~$6250 (before tax) worth of inventory for a chain store and got away with it.,56,zgypea,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/zgypea/in_high_school_i_destroyed_what_would_be_6250/,15,1670595999.0,"Here it is, The Helicopter Story (TL;DR) at the bottom, this is long:

When I was in high school I worked at a clothing department store (I won't name them, but they weren't ""baddy's""). I worked in the kids department, which was by far the easiest to keep up with, as parents would monitor their children in the car and just grab the sizes needed and leave. Since it was such an easy gig compared to the atrocity of the women's clothing sections, I was saddled with other things to do on my job. Makes sense right?

Well we had an attached warehouse to our store for stock. There wasn't ever a real inventory system, as we got various things from various places, and wholesaler lots of certain brands to resell. This is useful information for later.

Black Friday stuff came in in July, and there was a lot of it. So it became my job to organize the boxes against the furthest wall from our workable space until the time came. Just me. Some 600 boxes of various inventory, ranging from clothes to shoes to colognes to toys. While working on this I figured, ""Hey, I'll make a box fort."" I had a workable space of a 5 X 7 ft rectangle, with two different boxes to go in/out of. I opened a box with a bean bag and honestly just chilled a lot.

Our slow season kicked off in the beginning of October, as most people were waiting for the big sales for clothes, so I started spending more time in the box fort. I didn't have a nice phone so I got bored kinda easy and started opening boxes. One day I found these little styrofoam remote controlled helicopters. They came with batteries so I thought, ""What the hell?"" I'll just go for it. I opened one up and began getting really, really good flying these little fuckers.

There was a vent without a cover in our AC system in the warehouse that was never turned on, as we had a newer system that cooled from the floor. I flew a helicopter in there, heard it bang around, and I lost signal. It was a little risky to get there, because it meant flying over the workable area, so you had to be stealthy and not let yourself be seen.

Over the next month I flew 250 styrofoam helicopters into this ventilation system. It isn't exactly 250, because some of them were broken out of the box, and some broke on their voyage to Hole Fort, but that was the total number of helicopters I flew.

Anywho - Black Friday is coming up, and the boxes begin getting dispersed and I'm back to working on the floor like some idiot and by the time Thanksgiving comes around I'm not even thinking about them. No one has asked, no inventory to check. Woohoo, right? Just something in the mailer we won't have.

Well, this store is shitty, and you have to work on Black Friday, no matter what, or you can kiss your job goodbye. Not a big deal, I'm poor and I'll take the hours. I take the earliest shift, which is 3AM. Our Store Manager, Regional Manager, and General Managers are all going to be in at this time (the latter two are travelling to the other stores throughout the day), so I'll get a little brown nose points in for volunteering so early.

Well, in the warehouse they set up a huge spread of food. I'm talking the trays of various hot meats and breakfast fare with the flame under them to keep warm. Cool right? It is! Except it got really hot in this warehouse, and the floor vents weren't keeping up with all the people and hot food in this place.

What's to do? Turn on the old AC unit as well. It took less than a minute for 250(ish) helicopters, covered in dust, to come flying out of the open vent. More than half the food was covered in my precision-flying chaos and I swear to you I'm ready to shit my pants and praying that I don't have to pay for them.

I am eventually found to be the dumbass in charge of the inventory - and thanks to the narcissism of my mother, I had the silver tongue to lie my way into being okay.

How on Earth would I fly all these helicopters into a vent with no one seeing? I wasn't even here after closing ever due to being a student! But you know who was? Our overnight janitor that quit over a month ago. He got a sweet job in Canada with his brother. I can't believe this happend!

That was that. They tossed the food, got mad, and could not believe that Farhad would do that and just up and leave the damn country!

It's been over 10 years, I've told this story so many times.

Farhad, if you're reading this and you worked overnight janitorial stuff at a clothing chain (Think the opposite of ""baddy's"") between 2005-2006ish years, you are a real one and I hope no one ever contacted you. I'm almost certain they couldn't do anything anyway.

TL:DR - Shit wage worker for clothing store, flew 250ish helicopters to their doom, which in turn would doom a wonderful breakfast spread for myself and my co-workers.",2022-12-09 16:26:39

So the lady left without the Fitbit.

Yesterday, I saw my psychiatrist & whe she was called out of the room and I saw her pad, and something in me wankered head just told me to take 3 slips/pages. It's one of the most fucked up things I've ever done in my life,.. and I've done plenty

I've spent the last couple of hours of the night staring at the medication..shocked Igot it & also  didnt get caught... I well deserve to face justice and be recommited to an institution 

BUT, my biggest issue right NOW is that its 3am, I haven't slept, and I keep pacing around the room/flat, deceptively thinking it could be the answer to my current stress issues;, insomnia, major anxiety & depression issues. I only feel safe when am asleep hate every second of being awake despite not being suicidal at all; and with monetary issues (lost my business and subsequennfull time job during Covid), and me mums health is dipping fast, coupled with the fact that I took in my nephew as unofficial guardian, his mum, my sister, disappeared and only appears to visit mening ots just mean him in a one room flat. I feel overwhelmed by my actions & selfishness at the moment.

Am a walkiig cliche, & like many who suffer from major depressionn & anxiety, with severe OCD AND ADHD, coupled with PTSD from an abusive upbringing and a severely a traumatic incident at a mental institution that left me scarred & with severe agoraphobia for over a year after discharge. I know so many have it worse than I do so part of the guilt is also being ungrateful that I haven't been evicted yet, nor have the coppers knocked at my door, yet so any people in the world are much off worse than I. Yet am whining.

I joined reddit (with encouragement from my shrink) to help alleviate my social anxiety diorder, and severe OCD as posting & commenting with strangers from a distance keeps my mind from spiralling & helps with my obsessive thoughts as well as my compulsions . Hence, why I don't care If I post this on my actual reddit account even though it'll probably be nuke to death or just ignored, OR I'll probably receive anninfluz of deserved distasteful comments. BUT I NEED TO OWN MY FUCK UP and this is the only way I can rn.

I cant exactly say why am posting this as I dont care if its upvoted/downvoted. And dont know if someone can talk me out of it. BUT, figured I could try anything that doesn't involve swallowing the copious amount of pills am staring at on my wardrobe. I hope am not triggering anyone. I just feel so guilty for what I've done. Not only did I commit a crime, but I also undermined the trust and faith of  my shrink & more personally, I could break a 4 year clean streak when am 2 days away from celebrating my win on being clean.My nephew is visiting with family so I don't have him for the day but I also know that this decision would be unfair and selfish to him as well.

TL;DR: illegally got prescription medis to help cope with the stressors I've been experiencing recently coz I'm struggling with finances, mental health issues and getting fulltime employment to help care for my nephew and ailing mum.

So while they were in the shower I went ahead and got on their discord. I know they spend a lot of time messaging people there so I wanted to see if I found out if they talked about me to someone and possibly find a reason why they keep cancelling plans.  
I checked their most recent dm conversation and I found out that it's someone they apparently date (at least based on the kinkiest roleplay that is going on there)  
I read so much of their conversation, finding out that they had planned some fun roleplay times on the same days we were supposed to hang out. I shouldn't have gone to their discord. If I didn't I would still think they were as innocent as a puppy and I wouldn't feel so awkward around them.

Im talking buying a lot of 20 chargers for $100 cash.  I had a system down where I could strip down a scooter, remove the logo stickers and replace the board in it 30 mins, and eventually learned to break down the scooter into all scrap parts (electric motors, lithium battery, scrap aluminum) and took them to the scrap yard.

I intentionally damage my Landlord’s property in 2016,102,zallyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/zallyv/i_intentionally_damage_my_landlords_property_in/,36,1669986114.0,"Ok. So back in 2016 I was a college graduate. I was searching for a stable job while working 3 part time jobs (around 80 hours/week) just to make ends meet. I found a home on Craigslist with 2 other guys for around $450 a month to rent. The house was an absolute shit hole. Fiberglass ripping off, insulation coming out from the outside, stains everywhere, etc. I took photos and what not of my living area. I didn’t care because I needed a place to live. It was a small house less than 50 yards away from my landlord’s much bigger and nicer house. He was an older guy in his 60’s with a complete lack of care for anyone but himself. He refused to fix the siding and insulation issues even though it led to multiple bug infestations. During college football games, he would allow people to park in our driveway. Sometimes, blocking our way to leave so he could make $75 a car.

Fast forward to the end of my lease. My landlord doesn’t do a walkthrough with me and I get a letter in the mail keeping my $900 deposit for “damages” to the trap house. He also tried to add an additional $400 for carpeting damages. To add some context, his wife had died 1 month prior and the week before I moved out, 1 of his 2 dogs died.
I told him these were pre-existing damages and I wasn’t going to pay it. His response: “I’ll see you in court.” I paid the extra damages.

Not wanting to deal with all the court issues, I let it go. I knew I had been ripped off and it didn’t sit right with me. So around 2 weeks after I left, I returned. The house was on a decline hill into a wooded area with no cameras on the road. I knew he only had cameras on his house. It was around 11pm. I wore all black, covered my face, and approached his house on foot. He always kept his car parked outside. I slashed all 4 of his tires and fucked up his windshield. 

Fuck him and his dog. He’s gonna screw me out of $900, then he’s gonna pay $900. No regrets to this day.",2022-12-02 15:01:54

They were disrespectful and didn’t listen to me. This one student kept asking me questions as I was trying give instructions of what we’re doing for the day.

Some of these people may have been friends with me which is the sad part. I really don’t know why I did this or what I was thinking. People were kind of mean to me in high school for no reason, I wasn’t even weird I was just quiet so maybe this was my form of payback. Somehow they found out it was me but had no proof. I’m not sure how? I think it might be because a few girls noticed i was gone from gym class literally everyone thought it was me but had no proof so i just kept denying it over and over. The dean called me down and I decided to “tell the truth” and say I found $20 on the floor in there and took it and then returned said $20. I actually stole maybe $300-400 total over a few weeks span. I completely got away with it. But sometimes I still feel this guilt and embarrassment that I was like that in high school. I could’ve just stood up for myself better instead of being worse than those who make fun of me once in awhile. I was awful in high school and hated everyone because I constantly felt judged and anxious, but I don’t think people were as bad to me as I thought. Every once in awhile I cringe at myself and just wish I could go back in time and undo what I did. What makes me mad to this day is a few other girls were doing it and no one ever blamed it on them. The only person I don’t regret stealing from was this girl who was mean to me from elementary school - high school :)",2022-11-30 06:29:29
I gave a kid a cigarette to tell me who was giving him cigarettes,1509,z7lf06,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/z7lf06/i_gave_a_kid_a_cigarette_to_tell_me_who_was/,148,1669702372.0,"I’m going to be very ambiguous because I’m not sure of the legal repercussions but I worked at a facility that homes juveniles with mental health problems, mostly foster kids. I ran a shift for the transitional program (transition to independent living) with a coworker of mine. For awhile we had issues during our shift because the teenage boys (15-18) I worked with were “jonesing” for nicotine. 

I smoked at the time. I got tired of it eventually and I felt like whoever was supplying them was fucking my shift over. It was a lockdown facility so these kids were not working or doing anything that gave them access so I knew it was staff. I had a list but I couldn’t figure it out- I also wasn’t getting help from anyone. Nobody cared as long as it stayed under the radar and that pissed me off. 

I gave a 17 year old a cigarette to get a name and from there I blew the lid off the guy and caught his ass. Got confessions from everyone. Administration wasn’t happy about it though and took all privileges away from the kids until they gave up another name- which was specifically mine. I denied it through and through but I lost my job and the respect of my friends and coworkers. 

I lied to everyone about giving the kid a cigarette. I shouldn’t of done it- there was a right way to do it but I took the shortcut and it cost me a job I was good at and enjoyed. What drives me crazy the most is my reputation got destroyed and I had spent years building it up. 

I wish I wouldn’t of taken a shortcut. I deserved getting fired. Luckily I escaped criminal charges because there was no evidence.",2022-11-29 08:12:52

I was a regular stupid teenager and throwing snowballs was generally prohibited at our highschool due to risk of serious injuries.

Of course, this didn't stop me and many others from it. 

I vividly remember this one recession. The school yard was pretty huge but our school only had one main entrance that everyone used. So on days with nice weather, the entrance was always crowded with a few hundred kids trying to get back into the building.

Me and some friends had the stupid idea of a new ""game"" for this particular recess in winter. We called it ""snowball mortar"". We basically waited for the crowd to build up at the entrance and then threw snowballs in a very vertical, trebuchet-like curve into the mass, to let it ""rain"" upon random people from a good distance. 

I am pretty sure most of my throws missed and just landed on the ground, but  I witnessed one particular snowball I threw smashing directly on some small kid's (maybe fifth or sixth grade) head. I know that nothing serious happened because the kid kept walking towards the entrance but I am sure that shit hurt. I never ""mortared"" again after that.

I am sorry kid, I was an asshole that just did it for the laughs but I guess it wasn't much fun for you to get a huge and hard snowball rained upon your scalp without any warning. 

Sorry.",2022-11-28 14:19:00
I shot at cars with a paintball gun as they were driving on a highway,1327,z6nv9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/z6nv9p/i_shot_at_cars_with_a_paintball_gun_as_they_were/,218,1669613226.0,"I was young maybe 17, and me and couple friends were bored out of our minds one day so we decided to explore an abandoned house on a side of a highway. We parked our car a few miles away in a neighborhood and walked thru brush/ranch land in the middle of the night with our paintball guns to get to the house. We used to explore alot of abandoned places in our city so we learned to park the car as far away as we could and walk to the location to minimize getting into trouble. 

Anyway once we were there , the old house was in really bad shape and was practically falling apart on its own. We didn’t spend too much time in it and not satisfied with the situation, we decided to use our paintball guns to shoot at the cars passing by, because why the fuck not? (We were stupid) We all lined up , ambush style prone on the ground and tucked in between the brush. It was dead night and there was no way Anyone could’ve seen us, we wore dark clothing.  A few cars passed by, we all shot a volley of rounds but it seemed like we kept missing. Cars were going maybe 45-60mph so after a few tries and compensating for the speed (I remember we had to aim way ahead of the car it was insane ) we  started to get solid hits (we could hear the impact).  Most of them kept driving off (I’m assuming they thought they hit a rock or small insect or something) and we would just laugh like idiots every time we’d get a hit. However this one guy we hit, abruptly stopped and got out of the car immediately and started looking for us with a flashlight. I don’t know if he had his windows up or down so we may or may have not hit him directly, but I’m assuming we did. Judging by how quickly he reacted and got off his vehicle and searched in our general direction, he knew. We frantically started running away from the area and eventually made it back to our car and that was the end of it.  

Looking back at it, it was a stupid and idiotic thing to do, I wouldn’t like it if I was in their place. I apologize for whoever we stained their cars and that other guy who went looking for us who we may have potentially hurt.",2022-11-28 07:27:06
"i accidentally took a shit in my dorm bathroom floor, and no one ever found out it was me",14,z6husv,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/z6husv/i_accidentally_took_a_shit_in_my_dorm_bathroom/,5,1669595891.0,"I lived in a super shitty student complex building, it was 2 bathrooms (with 5 stalls each), 2 shower rooms, and about 14 or 16 rooms per floor. It was not even a proper building, it was a container ""building"". The living place was shit, and the people were shit but there is no need to go into that right now.   
So I woke up one morning to take a morning shit, and I was super tired and hungover, it was probably 8 in the morning. I took a fast shit, and it did not aim properly. So then the shit was on the floor, near the toiler. I did not even notice until I walked out and my shoes had a bit of shit underneath it. I noticed and said well why is there shit on my shoes and shit skid marks on the floor... I was too tired to think, and I went to clean my shoes quickly, then went back to my room and fell back asleep. Then I realised that there was shit on the floor, and it missed the toilet, but I realised that a lot later on.  

So then the cleaning workers came (they come once every week), and then I heard some mumbling and complaining from them and they put up a sign saying they will not clean it and whoever did it needs to clean it. Now the head staff worker for the student building texts everyone in the group chat saying whoever did it needs to clean it, and needs to come clean (no pun intended). He then threatened that whoever it was he will post a picture of the person and put it up on the wall (which is a weird thing to say if you are a worker, its unprofessional). Anyways, at this point I didnt want to clean the shit because it was dried up and shit, and I obviously did not have the proper cleaning tools that the cleaning staff had. I wanted to do something about it, but we only had standard paper towels and toilet paper. I did not have any tools etc to clean that. So then eventually it got cleaned up by someone (it had been like 2 weeks at least). People also think that an outsider or a drunk guy did it. (There are no locks to enter the building technically, anyone can enter, locks are only for our rooms).

i’m a freshman in college and i went back to my family’s house for thanksgiving break. 

i saw the fruit soju in the liquor cabinet and while it was tempting, i wasn’t planning to take it because i could probably find other methods of getting alcohol in college. i also didn’t want to get caught. 

but then yesterday we had a small family get together and i got drunk from that same fruit soju, and as I was going back to my room i impulsively took that bottle and hid it in my clothes in my suitcase. i think it was the rush and rebellion i enjoyed. 

i lowkey regretted it the next day but i was planning to leave to go back to college so i didn’t have time to put it back. i thought oh well i guess i probably won’t get caught since i packed everything. 

but then my dad moved all of my things into smaller suitcases so it would be easier to transfer back home. and i was like, oh shit, he probably saw it since he moved all of my clothes. 

he didn’t say anything though when i boarded the bus. i’m just praying he didn’t see it because that loses a lot of trust in me and my character, because i never was the rebellious type before. and now i’m anxious on my bus ride back. i should’ve listened to my gut and not stole the soju because i literally had other methods to get it anywyas. but i just feel so bad and i hope he didn’t notice.

update for whoever cares: unpacked my bags, soju was in a different shirt than where it was before. i felt so anxious and guilty i couldn’t unpack the rest of my bags, and i decided i should talk to my dad and fess up. the second i called him i started crying lol, not on purpose but i just felt so bad. i explained to him the situation and he was really cool about it, he told me i shouldn’t be sorry and that he wanted me to have a good time in college. i’m glad he was so chill lol, i’m relieved and a bit embarassed.",2022-11-26 23:06:21

Idk who's idea it was or who brought the cards but next thing you know we decided to play strip poker. Funny thing about this is that I don't think any of us really knew how to play poker haha. One by one clothes started to come off. At this point I'm starting to get nervous because I don't want to be naked. Once it got to the point that we actually had to take off our shirt or underwear we all chickened out. Thank goodness it was a general consensus to pack up the party and dip so none of us had to bare the shame of being naked. However that wasn't the last empty apartment we broke into.,2022-11-20 03:17:42

I only choose unopened expired foods to eat. I try to pay attention to what packaged foods are in the fridge, where they are, and then I keep track as to how long they have been there.

I will look at the expiration date and make a mental note to check on it 3 weeks before it expires. I then wait 2-3 weeks after the expiration date to decide to eat it. I figure by that time the person either has forgotten about it or the cleaning staff is about to throw it out. I have no problems eating any food, no matter how far past the expiration date as long as it looks and smells fine when opened.

I hate wasting food(money) and will go to great lengths to ensure no leftovers are thrown out. I even make sure to let my roommate know that I will gladly eat their takeout in a few days if they don't want it.",2022-11-20 02:35:19

So I did, now I don't know why I listened but I just did and I took the air tag and put it in the pencil sharpener (not the actual pencil sharpener but the case the leftovers go into) but then I think, Lemme empty the shavings out before I put the air tag in so I did but then the worst thing happened I DROPPED the air tag in the garbage bin so I instantly started searching for it and I just couldn't find it and then the kid walked back in the room and he checked his MacBook case instantly and I was fearing for my life but he didn't even suspect me so I just continued on with my day.

The other two people I was working with that evening just bummed about as per usual, going out for lots of smoke breaks when there was guests to serve. Usually any cash tips got put in the jar and split equally at the end of the night. I done everything for this table completely on my own, including making/running all their drinks from the bar to the restaurant, which technically I wasn’t meant to do but the barman was being so slow it was faster and easier to just do it myself. At the end of the night, the group were all splitting the bill amongst themselves. One guy came up to the desk to process their payment and told me to split the change between l all the staff. I was so pissed off with all the others for barely helping me that I kept the remaining £100 for myself and didn’t bother to put it in the jar. At the end of the night they asked how much they tipped and I said nothing. They were all really pissed off and I walked home feeling pretty smug about it. After a little thought, I felt bad for the chefs as the group said the food was delicious so the next night after work, the chefs and I all went out for drinks which I paid for but never mentioned anything about the tips.

This set me back a lot of money, I also had to buy new gear for my sport, and I had some other expenses that were miscellaneous.

I had like -3.00 in my bank account and if I did not put all my cash into my car I would not be able to make it home and drive to my paycheck the next morning.

I was decent. I pitched and could’ve probably played some JuCo ball, but that’s about it. There was a kid on our rival high school team, named Phynnex (yes like Phoenix but spelled like you were wearing a 2010 Cookie Monster snap back) He was a year younger and had just gotten called up to varsity because West High was pretty ass. Don’t get me wrong, the kid wasn’t terrible, but he got a huge head about it and started posting/tweeting shit talk about our school and a few of my teammates. I had known Phynnex since middle school because we grew up in the same neighborhood. Kid had a big mouth & didn’t really realize he was white, ginger, and upper middle class. He was S tier cringe. Anyway, I ended up finding his number from an old group chat I had from middle school. I had a different number now, so on the ride back from a road game I decided to send him a text pretending to be Rick Heller, head coach of the University of Iowa baseball team. I started out by introducing myself and telling him that we’ve had some scouts coming to his last couple varsity appearances. I told him we’ve been really impressed with how fast he’s moved to the varsity level and how we’re interested in having him down to throw some bullpens and “try out” in front of the coaching staff. (Keep in mind he was nowhere near D1 level) He ended up responding immediately with the eagerness of a 6 year old at a Toys R Us. He told me he’d love to come down and told me about his work ethic and how I “wouldn’t find a harder worker than him”…all of this unprovoked by me, btw, he just wanted to let coach know what he was bringing to the table! (why would a D1 college coach be communicating with you via text??) So…after a couple days of chatting with him on and off, and letting the rest of my team in on the joke, I had convinced him to make the hour and a half drive to Iowa City to meet “coach” that following Monday. The result couldn’t have been more rewarding. I later found out that Phynnex made his dad take off early from work, missed and entire day of practice to make the drive, and told his coach & entire team that he was being recruited by Iowa. To top it off, when he got to the field, he texted me and I told him to sit in the bleachers and the assistant coach would be with him in a bit. He then proceeded to post a snap story of him sitting in the bleachers with his glove pointed out toward the field with the caption, “My Day” which was sent to me by several of his teammates who I went to middle school with. He was clowned the rest of the season for it and I got a 2 game suspension from my coach who chuckled his way through telling me he had to sit me for what I did. He was West High’s assistant coach the previous year, so he knew Phynnex and didn’t like him, but he couldn’t let that go unpunished, understandably so. Over the next week, I received several texts, calls and threats from Phynnex promising to beat my ass. Ended up seeing him at a party about a year later. He made eye contact with me, and then left after about 10 min. Side note: his dad was that old dude at the rec center who would come up behind kids and give them pointers on their jump-shot & shit. They both deserved to be embarrassed, but I do feel bad that I spent that much time ruining someone’s summer.",2022-11-16 04:01:19

I was 13 at the time, in middle school. Although my family was dirt poor, my siblings soon had a phone of their own, but me. I felt a bit of an outcast at the time. I had no choice but to play with Barbie’s, fantasize about being in americas got talent, etc. the usual kid stuff. 

Anyways, I was getting so bored of it. I grew jealous of my siblings. They wouldn’t play with me anymore at the time, so I felt a bit alone. My whole family had a phone and they were so engrossed in it. I wanted to know what the hype was about. 

The kids in my class at the time also had a phone. Some classmates would even ask for my kik. (Kik was the shit back then lol, iykyk.) I got close to a girl classmate. She was very kind and had a very sweet soul. And so I would walk her to her class a few times. I did not really consider her to be a friend though. It was more like we just spoke to each other here and there but she was a really warm and kind person. 

One day at school in the hallways, a kid tapped my shoulder. I turned around and he said, “sorry to bother you but, is this your phone?” I stared at him for a few seconds, blankly. I was debating if I should lie or not, but, of course I did in fact lie. I’ve always wanted a phone. “Yes, thank you so much for giving me my phone.” I said with a warm smile. I won’t lie, I was a bit hesitant to tell the lie, but I just snatched it and left to the girls restroom. I could not believe I stole a phone. My heart was beating and racing. (I do not know why my heart does that when I do bad things… so don’t ask why it was beating.) I felt some sort of adrenaline rush, and the phone rang. I panicked and I ran away from school, I did not know how to turn the phone off or decline the call back then. But fortunately the phones battery was drained, so it turned off on its own. Unfortunately though, to my surprise, it was the girls phone. The very sweet and nice girl. I had her for the next class and she was talking to me about how she lost her Samsung Galaxy s5 phone and how it’s the newest model and it costs a lot. I told her, “don’t worry, I will help you find it!” But somehow I felt, she knew. She knew I had the phone but did not tell me, because the next day she did not want to talk to me which is understandable. 

However, the phone i had acquired, I had given it to my older brother because I told him, “I just stole a phone, please don’t tell my mom or dad.” But he asked to see the phone and threatened me that if I did not give him the phone to keep for himself he would snitch on me. That’s what you get for trusting your own sibling though.",2022-11-16 02:13:59
i used to be really mean in middle school and i dont know how to apoligize,17,yuoubb,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/yuoubb/i_used_to_be_really_mean_in_middle_school_and_i/,15,1668400218.0,"tl;dr i feel very guilty for being rude to one of my now closest friends when i was in middle school. i also have problems with having the energy to do things for her now. i am a bad friend

(sorry for bad spelling/grammar im very tired)

basically one of my best friends from Germany, ill call her M moved a bit before me and lives in texas(i dont live in texas).

i knew her for about a year in germany since we went to the same school and we talked online a lot more after we both moved. the thing is i used to be a huge piece of shit in middle school. i was still semi-emotionally recovering from my then best friend(well call her J) ditching and hating me. i was hurt and confused because my whole life friends didnt feel permanent, so id always brush them off because i knew id leave in a few years anyway(military kid). i always thought that my friends having hobbies or interests that J or her friends didnt like would make me seem ""lame"" and that J wouldnt wanna be friends with me again, even though J wouldnt have liked me again anyway. i shouldve actually appreciated my friends and their interests more last year.

id often brush off M whenever she wanted to talk in class, or break off from her to talk with my other friend, R. sure, friends do annoying things all the time, but whenever M did something that bothered me or R, wed talk about it. not to anyone else, just between the two of us. even doing it then with one person made me feel bad. yeah M got us in trouble, but shes a human too

i feel even worse because of she told me about how she used to get treated when she was younger. the way kids would take advantage of her and use her for money and talk about her behind her back. it made me feel like literal trash knowing i had done something similar. the BS i was going through at school/home werent her fault. the toxic behavior i see from my parents and peers shouldnt have affected me that much. and i feel worse because she still thinks im a good person, even though im not

i have a hard time responding to texts and remembering info. it makes me feel like a bad friend when i dont remember things that she tells me. i cant even say i try to remember because i dont. i dont have the energy to. whenever she asks me to make her a thing i usually forget or straight up dont have any motivation to, but i say i will anyway because i dont want to sound lazy or rude by saying no to her all the time

i used to ignore M and sit with my other friends in middle school. i was terrible. it feels like now im trying to make up for being such a bad person, but its hard. M wasnt the only person i treated like that, but she got it the worst. i dont know how to say sorry to her because i dont know if she realized i was doing that to her. shes said she hasnt had many friends before. i want her to stop talking to me because im a bad person. what do i do?

i know this isnt that bad compared to *anything* else on this sub but i need someone's input on it

edit: thanks to the people who replied, i apologized and fully admitted to how selfish and wrong i was at the time. she acknowledged that and accepted my apology. we're still friends. she is an amazing person",2022-11-14 06:30:18
I have been stealing my roommate's socks for the past 3 years and I can't stop.,117,yuonwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/yuonwb/i_have_been_stealing_my_roommates_socks_for_the/,52,1668399658.0,"For the past 3 years I (M26) have been continuously stealing my roommate’s (M27) socks. For context, me and my roommate have been living together for the past 4 years, he's a really good guy, and has never done anything wrong to make me wanna stop being friends with him. More context, he has a massive sock collection. When I first met him I thought this was funny and kinda weird but didn't question it because I'm quite odd myself. After maybe 10 months of living together I started to randomly get intrusive thoughts to just take his socks. I honestly don't know why, this has literally never happened to me. I'm not the type of person to just randomly want to steal things either. I decided to ignore these thoughts for maybe a month or 2 but then it just got worse. I would go to bed and a voice in my head would just be telling me ""steal his socks"". It started to become unbearable. I wouldn't be able to go a day without thinking about taking his socks. It was even worse when I would be hanging out with him after work. I would look at him and all I could think about was his damn socks and how I wanted to take them. 

At this point it was too much to bare, so I just caved in one night while he was staying late at work and decided to go into his room and just steal one singular sock. I put the sock in my drawers so then it would seem as if our clothes had just been misplaced. That night I went to sleep and felt so much better, it was a massive sense of relief and satisfaction. I thought that would be the end of it but no. A few weeks later I felt that same agonizing feeling to take his socks again. I didn't want to do it but after enduring a week of these constant thoughts I once again, while he was working late, decided to go into his room and take another single sock and then put it in my drawers again. At first I would maybe steal one or two socks per month and more recently (past 7 months) I've been stealing 1-3 socks per week. At first he just thought our laundry was getting mixed up but then he started to get very confused as to why he socks were just fully disappearing (more context, after maybe 7 months of stealing his socks I started to put them in my car instead of my draws because I was afraid he was getting suspicious, so instead of him finding his random socks around the house or in my room they would just fully disappear since he would never go into my car and even if he did he wouldn't be able to find them). 

He's also gotten quite protective over his sock collection, he even has spoken to me about the fact his socks are just disappearing and when this happened I decided to tell him we could look through my dresser to see if some of them got mixed up in my clothes. He agreed and I told him we could do that this weekend since I was quite busy finishing off some of my work. Before that weekend I decided to go into my car and grab some socks and then I stuffed them into my drawers so it would seem as if things were accidentally getting mixed up. He believed this and then seemed to stop questioning his socks disappearing and just went back to the assumption that they were just getting mixed up with my clothes and around the house.

I've been considering confessing to him but every time he brings home a new pair of socks for his collection I feel unbelievably excited. Before anyone says this, no I do not have a foot fetish and ironically, I actually hate feet. I also don't believe that this is some sort of kink because I don't get any sexual pleasure from doing this, nor have I ever masturbated to any of this. Another thing I think is worth mentioning is that I've never felt the need to steal anything before. I could go into a clothes store and see a bunch of socks and not even bat an eye. I just like stealing HIS socks. I'm also not obsessed with him, me and him could go ages without speaking and I wouldn't have a single problem. He's a really good friend and super kind and we have gotten very close over the past few years. I feel extremely guilty about doing all of this. He hasn't been very upset about his socks going missing or anything but I just feel like such an asshole for taking his socks for literally no reason whatsoever. ",2022-11-14 06:20:58

Once that kinda shut down and I had no money and hadn't started Robbing people yeti asked a friend of mine who had cancer to help me out as I was in withdrawals. 

I would normally help this friend out get his dope before he got sick. He was a popular kid in my city, a sports star and had just became an RN. He was def one of the ""cool kids"" from school and I felt like I fit in since I was the guy with the connect for percs and dope.

So he gets sick and we get into this cycle of me getting him a bag and him paying me and on top of it he would give me a handful of Dilaudid and morphine pills. I also must confess in my selfish using days I would even skim off the top of his bag and overcharge him so I would get extra for me, some money saved, and a handful of pptent pills upon return. We did this for months and I could tell he was getting sicker and sicker. I wound up owing him $50.

Of all the bad things I've done in my years of ripping and running and harming others, nothing has kept me up at night like my desicion to not repay my friend. I knew he was terminal and he kept asking for me to pay him back but I knew he would die soon and he did.

My sister and I threw mud on someone's face and ran away,203,ypx3u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ypx3u6/my_sister_and_i_threw_mud_on_someones_face_and/,21,1667938315.0,"This happened when I was around 6. I was visiting my grandma's house during the summer vacations. There was a garden in front of her house and we used to go there to play everyday. One thing I absolutely hated was that the kids there used to think it's fun to throw mud on each other. They used to have mud fights. But me and my sister used to stay away from this.

We had made a friend and one day she asked us to be a part of the mud fight. We refused but she anyway threw a lot of mud on us when we weren't looking. This made me and my sister so angry! But we did nothing about it.

We went home and thought this is not done so we started plotting for revenge. We had to leave our nani’s place in two days so the next day was going to be the last day we went to the park to play. We decided that we both will throw mud on the girls face just as we were about to leave the park and run back home (BAD IDEA)

The moment came and we took two hands full of mud and threw it at her face. She was shocked initially and started crying almost immediately. We ran away as fast as we could. Our hearts were beating fast. Our grandma's house is right in front of the park. Everyone could see where we ran off to. And we could see everything that was going on in the park.

We were looking out and we saw the girl had called her father and was crying really bad. I got so scared that I went and actually hid under the bed (as if that would have helped *_*)

But LUCKILY no one came to our house that day.

I really regret throwing that mud on her face. I should have just thrown it below her face or her back :)",2022-11-08 22:11:55

I was with my friend and we were hiding out above a little overpass in town. This overpass used to be old train tracks but now was covered with trees and brush.

Typically, not a lot of cars pass underneath but there were more than usual that day. My friend (who was more rebellious than I was) thought it would be funny to start dropping little rocks on cars as they drove by and convinced me to do the same. So, I dropped a rock and it cracked the unfortunate driver's windshield. They got out of their car screaming and we ran. Never saw them again but it haunts me to this day.

So next door neighbor went out of town for a week and I went over and knocked on the door just to make sure nobody was house-sitting for them.

I was parked on the street at the Tim but needed to go in the other direction on the street so I pulled into a neighbors driveway across the street and proceeded to back out (I was most definitely going waaaay to fast to be backing out especially without having great visibility). Turns out there was a car directly parked behind the driveway that I had pulled into and I hit the f*ck out of it. Instantly my heart dropped but I figured it was the neighbors car so I glanced at it as I drove by and never mentioned it to anyone.

Fast forward, when I got home from work that day my cousin was going on about how someone hit his rental car and didn’t even leave a note and that it was really bad.

I did some bad things in elementary school with a former friend,138,yjwc3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/yjwc3x/i_did_some_bad_things_in_elementary_school_with_a/,19,1667366258.0,"Back when I was in first grade, I had a friend who I'll call PJ. He was my best friend for a good couple years during elementary school, but after that we never really talked or even made eye contact all that much after all the stuff that happened.

Once, PJ snuck a knife to our first grade class. Luckily no one got hurt or anything, and even though he got caught by the teacher with it, he didn't get in much trouble. I guess because we were in first grade, no one cared because we were 6 or 7 years old, so how would he know better? At the time, I thought he was so cool for doing that, and that was just the start.

During that first grade year, PJ used to steal various first grade classroom items, such as these weird plastic cubes you can stick together to build things. He also stole some stuff from other kids and teachers, but he always got away with it. He encouraged me to do the same and taught me his ways, so I got really good at it.

This part's a bit embarrassing, but once in second grade, me and PJ went to the bathroom stall and he compared his penis to mine. I've told some other parts of my story to close friends, but never this part. PJ also looked up the 3rd grade teachers skirt a lot, and encouraged me to do the same. I hate that I still have the image burned into my brain of looking up that teachers skirt in 3rd grade, and it's even worse because she was one of the nice teachers too. I still never got caught though.

The end of the friendship happened in 3rd or 4th grade. PJ came up with a big stunt for me to pull off, it was to successfully steal an iPad from the school. Up to that point, I had never failed to take anything from anyone, I was a natural. So I managed to take it successfully, I stuffed it in my backpack when no one was looking and no one found out. That was until I got caught using it at home by my mom. She reported it to the school and I got in big trouble for it. I had never paid any consequence for stealing up to that point, so it hit hard. My mom also took devices away from me for a month, which at the time felt like forever. All that was enough for me to stop listening to PJ as much, shortly ending the friendship.

At the time, all of that stuff was cool and normal to me. But I changed and learned how dumb and weird all that stuff actually was.",2022-11-02 07:17:38

After the gig was over and we were packing up, I couldn't find my harmonica and bear trap (harmonica holder so I can play my guitar and harmonica at the same time). I had just payed $30 for the bear trap and the harmonica was an expensive Harley Benton. I couldn't believe someone stole my harmonica, because that's like stealing someone's toothbrush. But, I was out at least $100 which was half of what I made that night.

I had a few drinks and while loading out, I noticed a brand new shop vac in the corner and I threw it in my truck, because I was still pissed about my stuff that went missing. I got home, drunkenly bragged about stealing it to my fiancé and then went to bed. I didn't sleep at all. Definitely had stealers remorse.

I got up the next morning, drove to the bar, intending to leave it where they would find it. When I got there, there were already bikers in there drinking. It was like 10am. I rolled it into the bar and told them that someone accidentally put it in my truck while we were loading out and I was bringing it back.

They thanked me and offered me a drink, but like I said...it was 10am so I said no thanks and left. I learned that night that drinking makes you do things you wouldn't normally do, and revenge theft definitely isn't my thing.

So I think I took his cap (I don't remember) and threw it to the ""roof"" of one of those party tables Alex had. My parents got so mad at me (with good reason might I add) and scolded me. I got mad too, because I thought ugly people deserved to be hated. Alex's and Hector's parents didn't notice (thank God). I think my dad got it and gave it to him, so yeah ~~this is my evil backstory~~.

Moral of the story: Don't hate ugly people, they're still humans who deserve to be treated like humans. Like Reddit says,

I was a scholarship student at a private school (which I hated, both teachers and student body) and extremely poor; my mother and I lived in a one bedroom flat in an area of my city known to have some of the highest crime rates in the country. 

Anyway, throughout my childhood, and into my adolescence, I have been something of a bookworm. So going to a school with heaps of private funding, I couldn’t resist stealing their books. At first it was only two or three and I told myself it was a silly little mistake, but by the time I turned 16 (I had started there at 12), I had stolen easily over 100 books.",2022-10-27 15:55:04

"Through Unpacking My Own Abuse Trauma, I Realized I Abused My Brother as a Child",260,yb8pxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/yb8pxs/through_unpacking_my_own_abuse_trauma_i_realized/,30,1666501547.0,"I was raised in a very abusive household. In my earliest years, me and my mother were beat on by her boyfriends often. I couldn’t sleep because of it & I was the one there to help her feel better afterwards. We moved in with my grandparents, where everything just got worse. My grandfather physically abused us often, too. There was also a lot of insults & mental/emotional abuse. My mother was either gone in jail (an addict to various substances) or gone with friends for weeks at a time, leaving me to wonder & cry about where she was & for her safety, only for her to come back bleeding & drunk, needing painkillers. She even made me feel her wounds. She needed us to be there for her more than she could be there for us.

My brother is 8 years younger than me. When he was a bit older, around 6 & I was 14, I have memories of me being needlessly cruel to him. I would gripe about him all the time, I would be as harsh as my family was to me growing up. I would literally push him away when he showed me affection, and sometimes hurt him in the process. I would say awful things to him during fights just like how my family did to me. I refused to let him play video games with me a lot of the time. I keep replaying the times he asked & I said “yeah later” only to never bring it up again.

My family treated him better than me growing up. Part of me feels resentment. He wanted for nothing, but he always had issues in school. He’s 15 & he deals in drugs now with awful people. I’m the only one in my family who’s trying to help him make better choices, but I’m a sister, not a guardian. He hates me for it. He’s truant in school & everything. My family just yells at him. They put me in charge of disciplining him, & when I tried not only did he physically attack me, but so did my grandfather, only to talk to my brother with respect when he attacked me first. I moved out that night.

My point is, I feel so guilty for how I treated him. I treated him like my family treated me & I, his parent or not, had an impact on his childhood. Part of me chalks it up to my young age, but I just can’t allow myself any excuses. I wish I had another chance. I do love him & I want him to be safe & well. Im a lot more mature now. I changed his diapers, bathed him, and held him when he cried. He will ALWAYS be my baby brother, I just wish I understood that more at the time. I try to invite him out with me to the movies & things, but he doesn’t often want to go anymore.  I try to cherish the good times we have at home. We would’ve been closer if I had known better. Now, seeing him be enabled to ruin his life & being powerless to do anything, I feel personally responsible. Even now, with other family members & even an abusive ex, I had such emotional outbursts I’m terrified of my ability to get into another relationship. Maybe I should stay away. My potential for abuse is disgusting & terrifying. Most of all, I feel like absolute scum for treating a child like that. He was so sweet and innocent as a kid. I don’t know if I can ever forgive myself.",2022-10-23 08:05:47

During that time 2 coworkers of mine took care of all the office plants. We had desk numbers on some, some died, some were left for free when people quit. 

I asked out of boredom to rearrange a common area of the office, by a big window in a room with a sink to accommodate the office plants and take on caring for them and those 2 coworkers agreed and people loved the new layout and added ""green space"".

The 2 coworkers who knew who's plants are who's, both quit and have since been replaced. 

People are back working in-person, email's went out to ""come get your plants"" and some plants got moved back to their homes and some stayed. 

The plants that stayed started getting over watered. To stop this I took away both the notebook titled watering schedule and the watering can, also both were kept together in the window sill by the plants and I stopped watering them myself. 

BUT Someone's still over watering, especially the Christmas cactus I'd grown very fond of, it was dying a very slow painful death for weeks I watched it turn limp and purple.

 The other plants have better drainage and seemed to not be as effected as the cactus, probably because I re-potted many of them at my own cost but I ran out of  pots and soil to do them all. 

About a week ago I said ""fuck it"" And I took the cactus home with me one night. I figured it'd be fair if I'm going to do the work to buy a better pot and special cactus potting soil I should get to keep it.

No one has seemed to notice its absence, I'm just going to say it died if anyone asks plus whoever it belonged to had an opportunity(if they still work here) to grab it back in April of 2022.",2022-10-22 19:27:59

I flushed two of them at the exact same time. Now I don’t know if the school’s shitty low funding plumbing had anything to do with it but the water started rising- and it was rising fast.

Naturally I got the fuck out of there. I grabbed my bag, washed my hands, and made sure I wasn’t the last one out of the girls restroom as to not look suspicious. Sure enough maybe 10 minutes later (it was so long ago I can’t even remember) water was seeping out of the girls bathroom and out into the hallway.

I was talking with one of my friends when I asked them to politely move their skirt.

but a miracle happened. One of my friends that I had stood up for, found me apologizing a lot for what I had said. He talked to her and convinced her not to report me to the admin. It was all over, I felt so happy that she had not done it.

I was a heavy-wheeled vehicle mechanic at the time assigned to the maintenance platoon.  My Motor Sergeant and I both had one of those 20G MP3 players that cost like $400 (really high-tech at the time).  He plugged his into a 220 V outlet and fried it instantly.  Not knowing he had done this I agreed to let him borrow mine when he asked one afternoon.  

Later that day he gave it back to me and said, with this uncaring shitty attitude, “It’s fried.”  No apology, no remorse, no nothing.  I asked him what happened, and he told me he had plugged his MP3 player into a 220V outlet to charge and fried it.  So, he wanted to see if the same would happen to mine.  I was pissed.  All 20G of my music evaporated.  Music was one of the only things, other than letters and the rare phone calls to home, that I had.

One night my battle buddy and I had night shift in the motor pool.  It was just him and me.  We were mainly breaking down and rebuilding tires all night for the Battalion’s fleet of trailers.  Around 2 am or so we were eating our MRE’s and shooting the shit.  I told my battle buddy what happened and he got pissed, urging me to serve justice.  “Hell yeah!” I exclaimed.  I grabbed the Tabasco sauce from my MRE, grabbed my Motor Sergeant’s eye contact lens solution from his makeshift motor pool desk, twisted off the cap and dumped all the Tabasco sauce in his eye contact lens solution.

We finished our night shift and went back to our tent at 7 am when our relief arrived.  I forgot all about it and lied down in my cot to sleep a few hours before the vicious heat and sandstorms would rudely awaken me.  Now, I didn’t get to witness what took place next, but I got a good amount of amusement hearing about it.  Apparently, it wasn’t actually my Motor Sergeant’s eye contact solution.  Nope.  It belonged to this other dickhead (SGT Dickhead) who shared it with my Motor Sergeant.  SGT Dickhead tilted his head back and blasted his eyes with Tabasco-tainted eye contact lens solution and immediately began screaming and stumbling backwards.  My Motor Sergeant, looking to investigate the matter, picked up the bottle and blasted his eyes too.  They both accused a completely innocent dude (who knew nothing of the situation) of tampering with their eye contact solution.

that was good enough for him, he hands me the food and i have to stop myself from clicking my heels together on my way out of the building. i got to my car and canceled my order, told doordash i needed a bathroom break, and had myself a delicious sub sandwich. 
this became something i did, like as a meal ticket. 

i called it doing the 
Dasher’s Dash, and it was too damn easy. 

doordash ‘requires’ all dashers to have a completion rate of 80%, i could perform the Dasher’s Dash 1/5 orders, which was after about 2-3 hours of active time dashing. i did this at least once a day for about two weeks, it got to the point where i would chill around places like chipotle or chick-fil-a, because i knew i’d score something extra delicious. i know i’m not a bad person because as SOON as i started getting paid, i stopped. it made my stressful-ass life that much easier knowing that i had one meal taken care of for the day. 

so, yeah. it’s kind of funny to look back on that period in my life. i’ve since retired the Dasher’s Dash and i never get to eat chipotle anymore, but i’m here to say that it is entirely too easy to get a free meal from doordash.",2022-10-19 22:25:58

I went to a very good public school, but was on the very low end of the financial spread for the district (reduced price lunches, work-study program, etc.). My friend group of about 8 were all from wealthy families and we didn’t give a shit about each others finances, we just were friends. 

It is also worth highlighting that my school had a pretty severe drug issue since so many kids would just sell their adderall to one another, but I was pretty well known as a go-to for some pot. 

1 day a really obnoxious, super-wealthy kid from the grade above me wanted to buy weed from my friend at the lunch table, but got directed over to me. This is all fine, but when we were talking the kid made a joke about “maybe you will be able to buy some pants without holes since you clearly need my money” which would have been funny from a friend, but shitty from a random person.

So i ripped this fucker off REALLY bad. Like, a gram of weed for 80$ when it only cost like 10$ for anybody else. But this dude is either too stupid or too rich to care, so he agrees. 

This kind of pissed me off, since I wanted him to at least react to me being a dick on purpose, but i decided i would rather just take his cash and make fun of him later outside of earshot. 

But karma (or the devil) was on my side, because when he came over to the park to buy it after school, i watched it fall out of his pocket as he was messing around. I immediately put my foot on it and pretended to tie my shoe, but snuck it back in my pocket. 

The best part was he finally realized like 10 minutes later, and started freaking out trying to make everyone around look for his lost drugs, and not a single person helped. Teenagers would rather laugh at you suffer than help out, who knew?

I was called out of my room and had to explain what the hell all those purchases were, I ended up lying and getting away with it. I cant use it anymore but to be honest I kind of wish I didn't donate the $500 and kept it for myself since I haven't been watching Kwite anymore because I fell like if I cant donate I would be kind of a disappointment.

Just a throwaway account to get this off my chest. 

I already understand the huge mistake I’ve made and writing this post in preparation to actually tell my dad I have used that much of his money. 

My dad recently sold a property for about £231,000 and it was in my name so the funds were transferred to my account. It started off small where I’d buy some stuff I’ve always wanted like clothing items then buying some more expensive stuff like a PC and other technology. I have spent around £12000 in like 6 months and then my dad wanted to purchase another property and so asked me to do the proceeds to sending the funds to the solicitor which was £204,000. My dad buys property’s and then renovates them to sell on and during the last 2 months he has probably asked me to send him around £12000 for his costs and there’s about £3000 left. I know he’s going to find out obviously and the next time he calls me requesting for me to send money I will have to let him know I spent majority of it and offer to pay it back over time with my wages but I know that will delay the timings of his work as it will be at a much slower rate of like £500 a month. 

I’ve already accepted he will be very angry and probably disown me, which is acceptable with my behaviour. I feel very guilty and stupid for not thinking of the consequences and becoming greedy.

EDIT: I have mentioned it to my dad and he was very angry, I offered to pay it back and he bluntly agreed, hanged up and hasn’t spoke to me since. 

I’ve been made aware I could be under bigger trouble as my dad may have been evading tax with these properties and everything is in my name.",2022-10-12 23:08:16

First of all. I wouldn't usually do what I did. I come from a pretty poor family and I usually cherish this thing and believe myself not to be a bad person. 
It wasn't the first time I found a phone on the street. First time I was 16 and just waited around in the zone waiting for it to ring and return it to it's owner. I needed a phone badly in that time and that one wasn't half bad but I just thought that being a good person was better than a stolen phone. 
This time around I was 22. I had left my parents house and I had a really really shitty month. My boyfriend had cheated on me. I broke up a 3 years relationship. I had to find a new job and while I was going by the street, at night, I noticed this phone under a bench. I took it and I examined it. It probably belonged to a teenager girl, judging by the case and lock pick. It was foreign. Some turist from family vacation. It had little to no battery. 
I thought to myself that I didn't want to help anyone then. I just hated humanity. I thought about taking it for myself but I didn't need a phone. Mine was just fine and replacing everything is just a pain in the ass. Sell it? What if it has a tracker on and it follows the phone until it dies, directly to my home adress? I wouldn't want to wait till it runs off of batery. I wouldn't want to look for a seller for it. It was frustrating. I didn't know what to do with it but I couldn't just left it like it was nothing now that I found it. Then it hit me. I wanted to crush it. I would have never, ever had the opportunity to break an expensive thing just because. It felt so great. I feel like I wasn't myself in that moment. I wished that girl to find that phone and just ask herself why would anyone do that. I felt cruel, like the world had been to me recently. Just stupidly unjust and fuckd up.

I have ADHD so as you might think this will not end well.  So when they angered us we started having a full out  war with them, My friends sometimes showed their male parts to them. I sometimes put dogpoop thru their mailbox or pissed thru it. And sometimes we threw stuff at their windows. So my birthday ended 4 days ago back than and I had some new toys to mess arround with. I also had a supersoaker I pissed in than sprayed it all over nr. 10's windows. These guys HATED us. So, me and my little brother went to see a friend. Than I dared him to throw a rock at nr. 10's house, if he completed it I would give him my toys. My little brother went with him to make sure he actually did it. So, they started running to their house, grabbed a rock and BANG. their windows shattered. Their neighbours ran outside and tried to catch my friend and my little brother, The Friend got away. My little brother however didn't. They came to our house and my mother Snitched the friend. Eventually the Friend had to pay and we got away with it with 1 week of being grounded.

I came up with the best plan, I would put my envelope in her desk before we went out for recess, so by the time we came in no one would think I put it there. I would pretend cry and tell the teacher that my envelope was missing and who I thought took it. 

The beginning of the plan went perfectly. I successfully put it in her desk and went on my happy way to recess! All I had to do was fake being upset.

My middle school teacher was a real asshole. When I first started school, he asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I said a historian. He literally laughed out loud and said I “wasn’t clever enough” for that.
I really struggled througout school. I started off ok but my mental health deteriorated, I became completely withdrawn from my family, was flunking class most days, had hours of detention which I never went to, resulting in more detention. I started smoking & drinking quite heavily. My grades were shit and I was seriously failing at school. 
My dickhead teacher didn’t help. 
He had meetings with my 2 best friends & their parents, the sole purpose of which was to strongly advise them to stop being friends with me. 
He would mock me in front of the entire class. When we did a test and I got the lowest grade (which was usually the case), he would tell it to the entire class. It was like a running joke amongst the teacher & my classmates that the worst grade was mine. I never found it funny.
I once got 100% on a history test because I actually loved history and spent loads of my free time watching documentaries. Despite missing loads of classes, I passed the test with my own knowledge. I was really proud. He held me back after class, accused me of cheating, and failed me. 
As punishment for not handing in homework, he would keep me during lunch and after school and make me scrape chewing gum off of the bottom of the desks (which hadn’t been replaced since the 80’s) as he sat there and watched me. No one else had to do this. 
I hated my teacher and basically everyone else in my class.

Anyway, our class did a bake sale. Everyone had to bake something and then we would sell it @ break time to raise money for our end of the year trip.
Once the bake sale was over, I was in charge of counting the money and reporting back on how much was made.  It was my time for revenge. 

So one day during lunch, the teacher sat in the classroom with me as I sorted through the money. 
Lots of people gave money in coins so it was gonna take a while to count. He obviously didn’t trust me, so he was paying fairly close attention, but every time he looked away, I would slip a note or some coins into the pocket of my jacket. 
I ended up stealing about 200 quid. 
When I had finished counting, I went up to my teacher and told him we’d barely raised anything, and that someone must have stolen money. He believed me, because he’d been in the room with me and I couldn’t possibly be stupid (or smooth) enough to risk stealing right under his nose. 
He thanked me for being honest, and had a meeting with the entire class. They were all shocked and claimed no one had stolen anything. 

Seeing as the thief didn’t come forward, the teacher made everyone chip in some money to account for what was lost.

One day, my friends and I were messing around and led us up to getting detention for lunch. Our teacher made us sit the entire lunch with our heads down. I remember being so frustrated and wanted to get revenge on him since he was a total dick and our classmates where always afraid of him. I watched him sip his tea like a total douchebag and  I had the idea to spit on his tea. I told my friends about it and we laughed so hard about the idea I had planned. So we waited. Once the teacher left. We stood up and I decided to spit a really nasty loogie on his lipton green tea! My friends also decided to spit on the cup and we noticed it was too noticeable so we got a piece of chalk from the chalkboard and stirred the spit until it blended in. 

later on that day, I watched him drink the rest of his tea. I still remember that disgusting look on his face,I couldn’t stop laughing internally !",2022-10-08 12:46:54

I also never read a single book in high school and just used SparkNotes, and I still got A's and B's on everything. I graduated college last year with a 3.4 GPA.

The owner asked where I got them from, I told him I bought it a few days ago from another store but didn't have a chance to redeem for rewards. He complained next time I should redeem it there, but gave me my prizes anyway. 

I went back to Taiwan for a trip in my 20s and managed to find my way back to the area, but the store is no longer there.

The next day I went to h&m and proceeded to steal more than 100 dollars worth of merchandise. I showed my parents what I had ""bought"" and that was the end of the conversation. The following months I would steal everytime I was out, makeup, clothes, food, electronics. Anything I could show them to keep their suspisions away. My addiction got bad soon later and I ended up in the hospital and now I'm three months clean. The guilt is still there and I still have drawers of stolen stuff I can't bring myself to use.

My dad confronted me today. He looked at his credit card bill and said, ""Y/N, why did you spend 80 dollars on my card? Moreover, I want to know why YOU DIDN'T TELL ME."" I stayed quiet like I always do. Quiet like a useless child who doesn't speak. I had so many thoughts running through my mind, I was going through each one of them, trying to pick out a good excuse. I couldn't find one. So I stood in silence. I wanted the ground to swallow me up and suffocate me because I would rather die than see my father this disappointed in me. I shouldn't even be thinking like this I don't have the right. Here I am trying to play the victim, which was my fault in the first place. I was surprised I didn't even cry, I couldn't even show a little remorse to my father.

Then he said, ""Do you have a valid answer for me that justifies what you have done?"" Science as usual. After pausing, he says, ""I'm going to take away your phone for 10 days."" That was it? THAT'S IT? My little punishment! Going without my phone for 10 days! That was it! Then he waves me away. I would instead have gotten hit. Or maybe have my room taken away for a while.

I come from a financially conservative family, as a result I did not have many toys as a kid and did not have a PC for video games at that time. 

After numerous requests, my parents bought me an old computer which was only capable of older games. None of the CDs worked and the computer could not handle the game CDs my friends shared with me. In other words mu computer was way behind for it’s time. 

So I went in to an Internet cafe with a screwdriver. The Internet cafe has computers in cubicles with a door which provided full privacy. I basically unscrewed the CPU housing and took out the mother board, RAM, HDD and the power supply. Replaced all my CPU parts with the stolen ones and I was good.

After few days (10 to 12 days) I started feeling guilty. But I didn’t do anything about it. I didn't have the courage to admit my crime or the money to pay for it. 

Fast forward 5 years. I moved to other locality but I still have some friends at the area. I revisited the internet Cafe and saw that it was out of business.

To this day I don't know how I didn't get caught.,2022-09-27 12:50:07
I kept stealing random items from people as a child and never gave them back,60,xnk9f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/xnk9f6/i_kept_stealing_random_items_from_people_as_a/,32,1664103548.0,"So, when I was like 12? I went into my moms office and I stole some pretty basic things. Like sticky notes, tape, notepads, really basic stuff. (By the way, even before this I stole so many other random things from people so, this didn’t start a “obsession” just then.) Then once she found out someone tampered with her office she yelled at me and my sister,  she didn’t know it was me and it makes it even worse that my parents think I’m the “golden rule follower kid” and they think my sister is the “non obedient bad girl”. But I CONSTANTLY stole things. Pen on the ground? mine. Charger my parents told me not to touch? Mine. Food in the fridge? Mine. And it’s not even only at home. I had a whole COLLECTION of things I stole/ found on the ground that someone may be looking for. I had a swimsuit from a friend that I never gave back. I even stole two books from my 5th grade teacher and I still have them on my bookshelf and act as though they are mine.  I feel bad about it because I made my mom and others yell at my sister and a few other people because of my doing and I hate to see them sad after they got scolded for no reason. And i Never thought about the after effects after I stole the things and I feel so stupid 💀💀 (this may be a dumb confession but I feel bad about it so here I am)",2022-09-25 13:59:08

I stole brownie toppings from a frozen yogurt store.,1332,xn7til,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/xn7til/i_stole_brownie_toppings_from_a_frozen_yogurt/,150,1664063400.0,"Up until recently I had never had those little brownie pieces from frozen yogurt places, and I decided to try them the other day. Instant love. I went home and all I could think about was those brownie bits. The way they tasted, smelled, and felt in my mouth were immaculate. So yesterday I went back to the same store, which was open late. The worker must've been in the back or something because they weren't there. Then my primal instincts kicked in. I thought about it for a bit, and then I decided that if the worker didn't come back in the next 3 minutes I would take the entire tub of brownie bits. If I was caught I would use the karate skills I learned from watching Cobra Kai and take out the worker. I set the timer. 1 minute. 2 minutes. 3 minutes. Go time. I ran up to the counter and grabbed the tub by the edges, and ran out of the store with it. I drove home and ate all of it in my car. I don't think I'm in the wrong, but I'm worried I'll get caught.

Update: I returned to the store just an hour ago, and everything went smoothly. I got my yogurt, (with no brownies) and left. I had committed the perfect crime. I strutted out of the store. I feel some guilt for the brownie theft, although it’s not like a big company like Yogurtland will notice a small hit to their millions of brownie bits. Stop telling me I’m in the wrong by the way, I know. And I have 0 remorse.",2022-09-25 02:50:00

I stole money from my grandma as a kid and let my brother take the blame,98,xk6kzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/xk6kzz/i_stole_money_from_my_grandma_as_a_kid_and_let_my/,18,1663770780.0,"I was a bit of a klepto as a kid. My friends and I stole little things from the store but after getting caught, I was too scared to try again.

But then I found out that my grandma, who lived with us, had a vase full of cash she was saving. I was going out with friends so I stole a $20. Not like she’d notice, right? It was opaque and on a high shelf, so you couldn’t see its contents. She’d never know.

Well, every time I went out I’d sneak in and take some cash. Being a kid with no concept of money, I didn’t realize I was taking way more than she was putting in. Eventually I went to steal some more and realized that the vase was almost empty. If I had to guess, I probably stole around $200 (or more) from her. I quietly put the vase back without taking one of the last bills and didn’t go back for more.

Couple weeks later I heard my grandma calling for my mom because “someone” stole money from her. My mom asked my sister and I since we were there, of course we said no. My sister had a sharp eye and asked about a new shirt I was wearing (that I bought with the stolen cash) and I came up with a bad lie to explain how I got it. My mom was barely paying attention, and my grandma liked me enough to automatically believe me and move suspicion to my brother.

I never heard about it again so I thought it was dropped. I had always thought that my grandma probably knew it was me, but just never did anything about it. I brought it up to my mom as an adult and finally admitted my childhood theft and learned that my grandma actually thought it was my brother to the point that she spent days discussing it with my parents to try and get them to severely punish him. Luckily my parents believed him and as far as I know he never got punished, but I think it damaged my brother and grandma’s already fragile relationship. That was maybe 15 or 16 years ago and I still wonder if I should write my grandma a check paying her back or let the lie remain until she dies.",2022-09-21 17:33:00
I punched my drunk best friend in the face and he doesn’t remember it,1371,xix83q,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/xix83q/i_punched_my_drunk_best_friend_in_the_face_and_he/,87,1663642959.0,"Darius (fake name) has been my best friend since freshman year of high-school. We always had a special connection. Maybe it was because he was gay and I was a lesbian, so there were no expectations we had of each other. He is the closest thing I had to a brother, and with him being younger than me, I felt a responsibility over his well-being.
Over the past few years, Darius has turned into an alcoholic with additional addiction problems. Over the course of these years I did everything that I could do to try and get him help, but none of it worked. He didn’t want it for himself, and that is the only way that it can successfully work.
I resorted to distancing myself from him, but still trying to make time to spend with him. Yesterday he was drunk, yet again, but drunk to an extreme level. Drunk to the point he tried to rip my shirt off of me because he was horny. 
So I punched him in the face as hard as I could and left. I’ve always preferred to be passive and patient with people. I never yell, I never get visibly upset, and I especially don’t like to fight people.

But it happened. He doesn’t even remember it happening. He just thinks that he fell and hit his face. 

Yes, I defended myself. Yes, I have a right to be angry. But I also hurt someone that I cared deeply about and have finally realized that he is not the same person that I used to be close with anymore.",2022-09-20 06:02:39
I read my mothers text with her sister and now I regret it.,57,ximyaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ximyaw/i_read_my_mothers_text_with_her_sister_and_now_i/,8,1663617628.0,"Okay so for context My mum was married before she was married to my dad she had two kids with a man she was with before. My oldest brother and sister. she got a divorce with her previous husband when my sister was like 10. And then she met my dad and she got pregnant with him and they married and then she got pregnant again so  she was pregnant at their wedding. Then they had me with my dad and then they had my younger brother then my mum had another child but sadly she miscarried and then she had my little sister. So there are seven of us. My dad has some flaws he’s lazy he gets angry quickly etc but my mum knew that when she met him. He was even worse back then but he had a stroke a couple of years ago and he got on better he started going out with us and it’s started feeling like a real family for me. My mom she is strict but not as strict as but she has  to have an opinion about everything.
She told me that she wanted me to be a boy so badly and when I put sweatpants or just look a bit like a boy she comments on it and says you look like a boy like it’s a bad thing. And she keeps having opinions about how I look and what I wear and what I want. and constantly she picks on me but not just me also my older brother D she keeps picking on us and making us feel like everything it’s our fault. She doesn’t even shout at our older siblings because they’re adults my other brother who is one year younger than d it’s her favourite whatever he does she will forgive.  like he got arrested once and she didn’t even tell him off badly she yelled at him but that’s it. If that was me and d we would get yelled at and we never hear the end of it. And My younger brother she doesn’t shout because he’s younger and you know she just doesn’t shout at him and my younger sister she loves her she’s so spoilt. My dad has been very sick he’s been very sick since he was born he’s disabled. As I said before he was really really rude and bad and lazy and helpless but after his last stroke he became better he started going out with us he started talking to us it was like we were a family obviously still lazy but I thought my mum loved him. Maybe she does I don’t know but my mum makes me sign onto her messenger because she doesn’t know how to speak English so she needs me sometimes to answer a text to people who speak English and she was texting her sister earlier and I saw a notification pop-up on my phone from her sister saying “your not happy with ur husband?” So I read on and I saw how she’s texting about her previous husband telling my auntie how he was saying some stuff about our family how he always looks in the past and she says that she doesn’t care that her kids are the only things that she cares about and how my dad is lazy and she has to tell him off to make him go and do some stuff. one thing that broke me was that she said that if my dad wasn’t sick she’d leave him. I thought she was in love with him. I feel like if she could turn back time to before she met him she would she make sure she would never get with him and she would never have us kids I know she loves us. But she mostly loves my brother and my younger sister and my other brother. Whenever she argues with me picks  on  me I always think about once I turn 18 I can get out of this house and only contact her on her birthday and I don’t have to be in contact with my family. 
I know it’s wrong trust me I know I feel like this family is just bad for me I’m literally crying writing this. 

After I saw that text I started thinking if my mum ever got divorced my dad I  would probably stay with my dad. We live in England right now but we come from a different country my dad would probably move back home and I probably move with him because he is sick and no one to take care of him. I know my brothers and my sister wouldn’t go with my dad date through with my mum because they know they’ve got a big opportunity here in England and so do I but my dad for putting in some stupid opportunity. 

My mum she’s a great woman she her past is not the best she had to take care of her brothers since she was very young because their mother left them and now she brings it on to me she makes me feel guilty every time I don’t wanna do something like iron the clothes she’s like “I had to do this when I was younger” she just makes me feel really guilty.  every time she does I always just wanna leave. As I said she treats me differently to my brothers. I work with her and my other brother. The one she favours. And sometimes I wanna take the day of so I can hang out with friends and she shouts at me and makes me feel really bad but when my brother does it she doesn’t care. I think she doesn’t like me and I think it’s cuz I resemble my dad alot and my brother resembles my grandad  a lot. My grandad was a big part of all our lives and he sadly passed away in 2021. My mum and my grandad were very close the I’ve been living together ever since she was very young because their mum left them and he was always there for them and she was always there for him. I told her this many times that I feel like she doesn’t like me because I resemble my dad and she always laughed it off I even told her that I thought about self harming but didn’t because I got through that and she just yelled at  me why would I think that. Again making me feel like shit. Now that I’m writing this I realise she is one of the reasons why my mental health is fucked up and why i’m scared of men. The thought of being with a man in a relationship just sends shivers to my body and I don’t want to get married because I don’t believe in love. She did that to me. 

And the text I saw today they confirmed it everything I’ve been conspiring about my parents marriage has been confirmed. I knew my mum wouldn’t wanna be with my dad. She feels like she doesn’t have a choice which is not true she can get a divorce she doesn’t have to put my brothers and me through this faking she is happy in her marriage when clearly she is not. When I turn 18 I’m leaving whenever I get the opportunity to leave I’m leaving if she say something that will make me mad that is when I will let all of this go to her she will never see this post she can’t speak English or read so she will never see it unless one of my brothers tells her about it which they won’t because they don’t have a Reddit they only see TikTok‘s with the Reddit posts. Let’s be honest this will never blow up so I’m just happy I got this off my chest tonight and won’t have to cry anymore. maybe.",2022-09-19 23:00:28

I ended up in a mental hospital for a month, 6 weeks (38 days), and it was honestly a good time. I continued lying because I enjoyed the attention, and it was fun making friends, getting close with staff+nurses, ect. I didn't stop until I found out that I was going to a whole nother state for long term treatment. Apparently even though I was lying (they didn't believe it but said this for the purpose of keeping me content) I had to go for behavioral issues and my PTSD. I was slightly confused because I wasn't aware of my PTSD or ADHD for the whole time I was there. I'm still not sure when I'm leaving for my long term care, but I know it's in a few weeks.

We’ll turns out in that field was a big haystack and next to that was a tractor. We were all just hanging out drinking and having a good time. Couple more beers in my buddy walks up to the tractor and walla! The keys are in the ignition. He fires that thing up and starts taking it for a spin we all got excited and hopped in!! He was way to tipsy to be operating a huge machine and eventually took out half the haystack. I then noticed a vehicle with bright headlights heading towards us fast! I mean FAST!! Because all you see is a huge trail of dust behind the truck and see it bouncing. So we all quickly run out and hop in the car and book it out of there! We got out of there so quick that the truck didn’t have time to see us or the car especially with all the dust. We made it home safe with our hearts pounding. My buddy that was driving the tractor ended up telling us that he turned it off and threw the keys into the field.

This incident happened in the summer after we both had turned 18 and graduated, I'll explain our relationship because it may be relevant, I had a friend, let’s call her Evelyn which is not her real name, She was definitely out of my league in the dating sense, she was gorgeous, extremely out-going, ambitious and had a great personality snd a smile that can light up a whole room.

When I first met her she was having issues with her friends and needed someone new so we became closer. Eventually I started to like her and I still think she probably liked me back.
It was easy to develop feelings. She was my best friend, but it felt like more than that. We would hang out and neither of us would want to leave. We would stay up talking till 5 or 6am and lose sleep just to spend more time together.

One time we went to a party thrown by one of our other friends, and we both started touching each other until she nicely asked me to stop, I didn't stop though. I kept feeling her up and for about 15 to 20 minutes while she kept telling me to stop and I just kept going eventually pushing both my hands inside her pants as she tried to hit me off, she cut me out and so did our friend group and to make things worse over the next three most I stalked her online trying her to get our friendship back and I told all the guys what happened because I was a bitter idiot, I was young and immature, I now have a long time girlfriend and I ABSOLUTELY wouldn’t do this again, but I never stopped feeling guilty for it; and nor should I tbh.

I also checked her instagram recently and I see she’s part of some SA support group, god it makes me feel sick to my stomach.

My sister took me and her kids to her friend's house for a birthday party. I'm pretty sure the party was for the kid who I stole from. I can't remember a lot of specifics but we were in the living room and I noticed a piggy bank. Luckily for me, it was located on the bottom shelf of like a side table. It was basically located somewhere where I could place my arm and take bills out of it and still not be noticed. So I took my time and would periodically go back to where the piggy bank was and pull bills through a hole on the bottom(you'd have to unscrew the plug to access the hole). I tried going for the big bills but I couldn't guarantee what I would get since I couldn't look and be obvious. I kept taking money until it was time to go. I'm not sure when it was that I realized the biggest hurdle I'd have, but it dawned on me that the money was useless to me unless I could spend it. And how was I going to explain the random ~40 bucks I now had. It took me a while and I'm honestly surprised my parents bought it, but I decided that I'd stash the money under a soda machine outside of the local grocery store and act like I randomly spotted the money wedged under the machine. I remember stressing over the timing because I didn't want someone else to actually randomly spot the cash but I couldn't be suspicious and do something out of character that would make them take notice of me. Unrelated, but it was a Mr. Pibb machine. Idk how, but it worked. I feigned surprise and showed them what I had ""found"" and they couldn't believe my luck. I have no idea what I spent the money on.

We go out the next day in the middle of the night in my old car. Our older friend told us the road the sign was on has cameras so we removed my back plate about a mile away and were also going to remove my front plate but I forgot it’s not screws it’s bolts on the front. We backed into the road and I sat in the car waiting for my friend. 
We had to cut the sign in half since it was pretty long and my old car isn’t big. I was wondering what was taking so long so I go out to check on my friend and I see that the hand saw broke. He tried to use the serrated part of his knife but then his knife broke. I ended up holding the sign while he used the piece of metal off the hand saw trying to cut the sign as fast as he could. About 10 minutes later a truck pulled up on the main road and sat in front on my car for a few seconds (most likely to write down my plate) then pulled in next to my car. My friends girlfriend came with us and got out of the back seat to see what the woman in the truck had to say. She told us we were on private property and had to leave then left. As soon as she was gone down the main road my friend stood up, jumped on the sign and it broke. We put everything in the trunk and drove back to town in the opposite direction. As we were driving back to town the same truck passed us probably looping around to see if we were still there. When we were unloading everything is when we finally realized the sign is government property and we just committed several felonies.
A week later the sign is hidden off my property, we aren’t wearing the same clothes we did that night for awhile, my old car is chilling out of sight, and I’ve finally calmed down. 
The lesson learned from that experience: Always bring a back up saw.",2022-09-11 01:34:15

I live in small neighborhood that is in the country side, which there aren't much people that live aroumd here. Well one night when I was 8 or 9 years old it was hard for me to fall asleep, I was just laying there in my bed staring at the ceiling from 8:30 to 12 something. I  had gotten scared and I started to cry. So I walked over to my sister's cabin, I opened tge door and popped my head inside to look around to see if my mum was up or not. It was pitch black inside the cabin and I got scared and I shutted the door quietly thinking my mum and sister didn't see me or heard me. I ran back to my bed with tears falling down my face. I just laid there crying for about 5 minute and after I settle down my sister came into the house asking if my siblings went to her cabin, she then asked me if I did and I said no. After my sister asked the whole family she went back to her cabin.

The next morning a family friend let call her Mia came to visit and my sister and mum told her that someone tried to come into her cabin. They also told Mia that the  person was the same height as her son. I felt guilty that they freaked out and I didn't know how to tell them that it was me not a random person. After that incident my sister now locks her doors. 

P.S. okay so my family have quiet a lot of land that we live on and so my parents that it would be good to rent a portable cabin that is right next to my house. And my mum was staying over my sister's cabin to help her with her new born baby.

Eventually I started selling them to kids in my class. These were 15/16/17 year olds and I know for a fact I either re-sparked somones love for opiates or was feeding their addiction. We would do lines in the computer lab and just nod out while doing our online courses. 

Eventually my gramps moved to a nursing home and passed away and I had to face withdraw and finally understood wtf I was doing, I knew it was addictive but I didnt know what addiction/dependence/withdrawal was. I hold an immense amount of guilt. One of the guys is now homless and an addict, another is struggling to stay clean. 

I had 0 reason to sell them apart from being greedy and wanting more money than I already had. At one point I stole an envelope labeled “$100” from him and it had a grand in it. When I opened it up after I got home my heart dropped as I was counting the money. Stealing in itself was very euphoric, almost more so than vicodin.

I set a bathroom on fire in 7th grade and nearly burned the school down.,1431,x8g4b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/x8g4b5/i_set_a_bathroom_on_fire_in_7th_grade_and_nearly/,62,1662583819.0,This happened back in 1999 during an English class in middle school. I had to go to the bathroom. I decided to use the secluded bathroom because hardly anyone used it and it was as far from my class as possible and it would take me more time to go and come back so less class i had to sit through. I found a lighter earlier in the day on my way to school and while I was sitting in the stall taking a shit I decided to start playing with the lighter by setting individual sheets of TP on fire and dropping them on the floor to wach them burn. This went on until I finished and as I was leaving I got the brilliant idea to just set the whole roll on fire and let it burn as I left. We'll no sooner do I get back to class then the fire alarm goes off and the school gets evacuated. I had assumed that the roll would just burn and that would be it as it was in one of those metal toilet paper holders....well I was very very wrong. I found out later that not only did the stalls get set on fire but the burning stalls had began to set the timbers in the walls on fire too. If it had not been for the fire station being less than a block away it's likely a large portion of the school would have burned down. Luckily for me I was never found out. Because I used the bathroom furthest from my class room I wasn't a prime suspect but I was still questioned along with the few other kids who were also out of class at that time. No one was ever blamed and after that a school security officer or hall monitor had to escort anyone who wanted to go to the bathroom during class for the rest of the year.,2022-09-07 23:50:19

I drive that machine that clean the floor, in a supermarket, I am alone this evening, the only employee of the cleaning team, I was asked to clean the warehouse of the supermarket.
Now, I've never cleaned this part of supermarket, I only cleaned the aisles etc, never the place where they stock all the products.
I learned to drive that thing only last week, it's still new to me but I was confident I could do it alone, I cleaned the supermarket with it at least 3 mornings.

Well, it all went to shit. I was cleaning, and there was that, metallic plate, on the floor, I don't know why it's here, it's just part of the floor of the warehouse.
I went to drive over it, because I always do, it's on my way to where I park the machine usually.
I didn't pull up the “suckers” this time (the things behind that suck up dirty water), because I thought I had to clean it here too...
I heard a loud noise, stopped the engine, and went to look... a big scrap of metal was stuck out of the suckers, it probably got caught in the metal floor and bent...
I pulled up the sucker, drove to where I park it, and tried to bend it back with pincer, tiny hammer... and it ended up breaking that scrap of metal. I was freaking out, so I thrown the metal piece in the sewer...
I told one coworker only, he didn't seem too concerned about it, told me my superior was gonna fix it...

i became like a full on psychiatrist. i had two clients. they were depressed but their parents were against therapy and medication so i started them with 50mg pills cut in half for 2 weeks, then 50mg pills for 4 weeks. then if they didn’t have any side effects 100mg. i checked in with them and gave them the pills and sold them for like $10 a bottle. 

it wasn’t really to make money just like to buy weed lmao.

One time I was doing a work order and happen to look over and see this huge bottle of Adderalls the tenant had. Following another smaller script next to it. It was a 90 day script. I was in a very active adderall addiction (6 months sober). 

 So after I saw that I went above the same day and took a few. Then there was about 10 more times over a 4 month period I did it again. I was so fiend out I studied the tenants car and his schedule. When id see them leave I'd execute right there grab they keys, and take a few days worth if them. I don't know how they never noticed or what. 

  After my last time doing it I took like 7 and got really freaked out debating on taking them back, thinking he finally may notice. Never heard anything luckily.

 What made me stop was a mushroom trip shortly after that, making me realize how terrible that is to do to someone. I have never done it after that last time and I still think about and feel so bad. Especially because I have never stolen from someone before, especially at that type of level. Realizing how much trouble I could get in and how morally wrong it is, made me stop.

It started out in second grade when I was friends with this one boy. We hung out all the time and had a lot in common and I still have positive memories associated with our friendship. Then one day a flip switched in my brain. I have absolutely no explanation for it I just didn't like him the same anymore. This was about 15 years ago so my memory is not strong, but I remember from then on I just avoided him and was mean to him anytime he tried to talk to me. During this time of me avoiding him our parents scheduled a playdate for us at his house. I think I tried to get out of going, but went and he was so mad/sad and just tried to tell me how he felt but we fought and then his mom got involved. I remember him crying and his mom asking me why we were fighting and I think I just said something along the lines of, ""I don't like him anymore."" or ""I don't want to be friends anymore."" and she looked so disappointed and sad. I will never be able to forget that day and I'm sorry Michael that I treated you so poorly and destroyed our friendship. He didn't come back the next year. I caused him to change schools.

The next year I just got worse. Again I had a friendship with this other boy. This time we had usually a group of three or more and we always played together. I think maybe this time I was jealous of the attention this boy was getting from our other friends. I don't remember exactly how I felt I just know I started being really mean to him and tried turning our friends against him. I would yell in his face whenever he came up to me and for some reason despite how I bullied him we had an on and off again friendship. This lasted from about third to fifth grade and then I moved many states away. I kept in contact with one kid from my elementary school and when I was talking him a few years after it all he told me that the boy I bullied threatened to shoot me if he ever saw me again. I don't blame him for feeling that way. I made him miserable for three years. We were just kids but I treated him like dirt. I'm sorry Emmanuel, you didn't deserve to be treated that way at all. You did nothing wrong. 

I know I don't deserve their forgiveness. I wish so badly that my actions in the past weren't hurtful towards people. No amount of regret and guilt will undo the damage I caused. I just hope that they've moved on and don't look back on their elementary school years and only think of horrible memories because of me. I'm sorry.",2022-08-30 08:08:33

Around this time my school had just started collecting phones because they hated the students having it. so like a week into me having a broken screen my friend suggested that I lie and say that the school broke it. Now I wasn’t against the idea at all, I just didn’t know how to go about making them believe they did it. 

(A little backstory, this is what made the staff believe it. I was a bit of a hothead in high school, I got angry easily, and didn’t know how to just walk away from idiots who liked to run their mouths off about me behind my back. so I was kinda always in trouble for fighting or getting into some kind of argument, So basically all the teachers knew me.)

So my friend devised this whole plan to make it believable. Since the screen wasn’t visibly cracked, he wanted me to turn my phone off before I turned it in so they wouldn’t see the screen and also avoid it turning on when I get a notification throughout the day, since they would have the phone and possibly see it. We told my friend group the plan to have them act as witnesses and say the screen wasn’t like this before today just incase they decided to do an investigation, and my parents didn’t know my screen was broke cause I never told them.

The end of the day is finally here and we get our phones back and my friend is like “Now throw a tantrum” im like “what?” He said “Just get mad, accuse her of breaking your phone and start cursing her and everyone else out” I remember thinking “this was his plan?” So I just went along with it and did it. So like mid (fake) tantrum, security guards come with the principal and “calm me down” they ask whats wrong and I tell them how “my phone didn’t look like this before I turned it in but all of a sudden my screen got random ass lines all over it now”. Everything from that point on went according to plan, they asked all my close friends if my screen was cracked before, called my parents told them the situation and also asked them if it was cracked before. After getting no knowledge from either of them, my screen was fixed within the week, my principal took my phone to a repair shop and paid out of pocket for a new screen.

Here I am 5 years later thinking back on it and  asking myself “was all of that necessary?” Cause I wasn’t someone who broke their phone every 5 minutes so my mom probably would not have cared and just got it fixed herself.",2022-08-29 12:35:32

There's this shop that is owned by a really sweet lady and It's this witch shop that sells tarot cards, crystals ect. 

I went in and there was a small group of kids around 11-13. They were obviously only there to make fun of what the lady was selling. The two eldest girls walked out without purchasing anything but the youngest, a really short boy, decided to look at the crystals. 
He was just pretending to be intrigued.

Whilst the owner and her apprentice (?) was talking about retirement plans and whatnots, I saw the boy take a handful of some tumbled crystals and also a necklace. He walked straight out.

I didn't know what to do. Outside I saw the boy and the two girls giggle at eachother. I believe the boy was trying to impress the girls.

Anyways, I gave them a glare before carrying on with browsing. I picked up a nice bracelet and a deck of tarots and I went to the counter. The lady was still talking with the man sitting next to her so I just put my purchases down and she quickly scanned them and gave me some advice about the tarots. I smiled and left.

Back then I didn't want to disturb their conversation but now I regret not saying anything about the kids. 
I feel like I should've at least said something so they could've had their lessons learnt and the sweet lady could have some justice.

I feel like I'm over thinking the situation though because it was only a few pounds worth and there was plenty left. 

I'm glad I got that off my chest though because it has been eating at me for the last few days.",2022-08-29 02:59:14
"I shoplifted a small item from a retail store, and am now racked with guilt and paranoia",339,wz9xqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/wz9xqy/i_shoplifted_a_small_item_from_a_retail_store_and/,102,1661625099.0,"My apologies, if I'm using this incorrectly, I haven't really been on reddit before.

I'm a young adult that, for unknown reasons, decided to pocket a small item ($<10) in a retail store, having never done so before. After pocketing the item, I then continued shopping and checked out with the other item that I had actually come to buy, and left the store as they were closing. It didn't seem that anyone was attempting to stop me, and there was a guy that worked there standing at the door, so I walked out as I normally would to my car. Afterwards though, in my car, I realized that there was a short beeping noise, but this also is a retail store that has a lot of beeping sounds at the entrance/exits, and is notorious for alarms going off even with legit purchased items--However in the moment of slowly walking out in a daze, I didn't even react to it.

I'm now now feeling extremely anxious, guilty, and shameful--having difficulty sleeping, and feeling unsure what to do.

Maybe just paranoia, but I'm also worrying that my legit purchase could be tracked, or if someone had tried to talk to me and I genuinely didn't even notice. I was in the store for a long time, as I'm extremely indecisive when I'm shopping for things, and though I believe I was discreet, I'm sure they could find something if they looked through the footage closely enough and for long enough.

I have considered just returning the next day to explain my mistake and pay, but read that this could actually result in my being prosecuted.

From looking into it, it seems that I could be fined a small amount and legally prosecuted, however I'm also about to return to college and am worried I might lose that opportunity if a misdemeanor were to come my way.

Thanks for reading this, and I would appreciate any responses as to whether I should be concerned, or just put this mistake behind me as I'm clearly not psychologically built for shoplifting",2022-08-27 21:31:39

No dint feel bad and say I was a kid and such bc I was a horrible person for 35 yrs. I have changed some over the last 5 but overall I'm pretty shitty. I wanna start also and say yes I'm a recovering drug addict. If you suffer from addiction issues or have worked with addicts then you may know addiction usually starts before drugs. I was a horrible kid a d I could post 100 different things on here. Today  what I'm posting is 100 true and all from ages 10 to 12. I guess I'm confessing how shitty a person I've been my whole life.
So growing up in the 90s I was attracted to rap music bc my parents hated it. They banned me from listening to it and it made it even more appealing. However since they would not let me listen to it I had to find ways to get it. So I was around 10 or 11 in 1992 and we had a Kmart. One time I Kmart I decided that since I had no money and mom would never By the new Bone cd, it was E 1999, so that should give a date, I was going to steal a copy.
So even though this was a long time ago Kmart still had there cds in this plastic thing to prevent shop lifting. However me being the piece of work I am I decided I would find a pair of scissors in the store, take the cd from rack, go to bathroom and cut the plastic shop lifting thing off and hide it in my waist band.
This is exactly what I did. I can remember this vivid. Like I said the first cd I ever stole was Bone E 1999. Needless to say I ended up over the next 2 years stealing probably 100 cds from the Kmart. I never got caught until I stole a cd from the mall at 13. It was a Nirvana cd i was stealing for a friend. I also stole this guys baseball cards and blamed his neighbor. Like i said no idea why i was so bad other than addiction manifesting before drug use. Overall there is no telling how many I stole. I'd say 100s. I would steal 3 at a time sometimes. Just put them in my waistband. 
As I said I finally got caught at 13. I stopped for a while. Then in resulting in stealing from my moms purse to purchase fucking cds. I'm really getting emotional writing this now bc what kind of kid does this? I've been in therapy but damn this isn't even tip of ice burg for all the foul shit I've done. 
I'm not seeking pity but this has definitely brought up some emotions. Also drugs have helped me mask these emotions for years.  I was a piece of shit at 11 years old. Thank God for my kids and wife. I have changed some but I struggle with  relationships so fucking much. 
Ok just wanted to get that off my chest. I also stole money from a woman's purse at church in 8 th grade. Holy shit I'm not proud to type that but it's the truth.

I stole all of a kid’s Skylanders in elementary school…,200,wxyr7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/wxyr7w/i_stole_all_of_a_kids_skylanders_in_elementary/,43,1661486096.0,"I was in 2nd grade at the time and at my school, besides Pokémon cards, there was one thing everyone obsessed over and that was Skylanders (and I think every 2010s kid can agree to that).

Kids, including myself, would talk about what Skylanders we had and which ones were the coolest. What we would do, similarly again to Pokémon cards, is we would trade Skylanders because it wasn’t common people would get brand new ones due to parents not wanting to waste cash on them. But it wasn’t as simple or easy as trading Pokémon cards as we could just pocket those and bust them out when we wanted, no, the figures weren’t as easy to bring and they were likely to be swiped so kids would basically agree to a transaction one day and the next they would bring in the specified Skylander and trade in the lunchroom like it was some illegal Skylander drug trade. I specifically remember trading my Prism Break for Eye Brawl like this.

I’m getting a little off topic, anyway, I knew this kid in my class and I didn’t really like him because my despicable 8 year old ass didn’t like he had a speech impediment. He liked Skylanders like everyone else and said he had some. I told him to bring some in for the morning and recess and I would do the same. The next day he brings in the goods and I do the same with some of my own Skylanders. We played around with them on the bleachers before class started, had fun, but this was all according to my plan. 

Come lunch, I tell the teacher I forgot my lunch box in the classroom. She tells me to go get it and when I get back to the classroom, the room is dark and I’m all alone to continue with my plan. I go to his cubby and find his already unzipped backpack and lying within were his precious Skylanders. I grab only one as not to arouse suspicion and put it in my own backpack. Before I head out the door, my childlike greed overwhelms me and I compulsively grab another one. And another. And another. And another until they’re all in my backpack. Satisfied, I head for lunch and go about the day like normal.

The next day. I ask the kid if he brought his Skylanders today and that I was excited to play with him. He bursts into tears and says they were stolen. I tell him that I’m sorry and that it wouldn’t be smart to bring anymore from now on. When he wasn’t looking, I swear I smiled like a cartoon villain.

I’ve never told anyone about this and this memory makes me realize how much of a selfish prick I was as a kid and the feeling of victory I once had over tricking and seeing this poor kid cry now only fills me with deep remorse especially since I specifically targeted and manipulated him because I didn’t like his speech impediment.

I can’t remember what Dave said/did but he was annoying me and some of the girls in line to get rulers. So, I leaned over and ended up stabbing him with my pencil. It didn’t leave a huge mark with lots of blood but it *was* a cut. Cuts hurt and have a bit of blood sometimes, after all. He was upset and mumbling under his breath how he was going to tell on me as I desperately begged him not to. I was left panicking the entire lesson until he finally got up after the teacher finished and told on me (lol). But one thing to know about me is I’ve always been a fairly chill kid and am known as the quiet one. So when the teacher asked to speak with me and questioned if this was true, I lied and said it was an accident. I told her she was bothering my friend so I tried to tap him on the shoulder but he moved and got scratched. Surprising she believed me and he got scolded for annoying my friend.

The goal of this project was to create a museum exhibit of sorts centered around that figure with images, a slides presentation and is having to create a costume for our figure. Oh and just to clarify this was not a group project. On the day before the projects were due a friend of mine sent me their slides, (for what reason I don’t know as this was an individual project but I figured it was for peer feedback at the time). Naturally I went to check out the slides they sent me and I was curious if I would actually be able to edit it(I somehow had editing rights) so I deleted one word that seemed out of place. In retrospect I don’t know if what I thought was an error was even an error because at the time I was pretty infamous for having tons of grammatical errors in my work. That’s especially because I don’t remember what exactly the sentence even was, nor do I remember what word in the sentence i cut out. That was all I did before I realized I had full editing access. I realized that my friend was still working on their slides so I immediately left to leave them at their own project. The next morning I told them that I thought their slides were pretty good and I admitted that I did make that one tiny edit. They were extremely angry at first saying that their dad helped them make those slides and that their dad would be super pissed however it seems that they soon forgot about it as we did still stay friends for the next couple of years, all throughout middle school. At this point I doubt they remember this whole situation but I really hate the fact that I did it because I feel kind of like a scumbag for editing someone’s project,even if the edit was nearly impossible to notice because I did not have to right to think I should be able to do that and get away Scott free. Especially since my edit might have made their project worse(not significantly admittedly) by potentially creating a grammatical error.

I’m an estate agent and was forced to steal deposits from purchasers.,172,wwjyd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/wwjyd6/im_an_estate_agent_and_was_forced_to_steal/,38,1661348620.0,"Long time ago, but why not get it off my chest. 

7 years ago, I was working for a well-known estate agent (UK) in London. 
The business had a slight reputation for being what I would call a “typical estate agent” in that regular sleazy salesman tactics were paired with inexperienced estate agents which left bad impressions on most who would deal with the company. 

Anyway, there was a scheme, which involved holding deposits from purchasers which were held by the company to secure a house once a buyer has agreed to purchase a home. 
Usually, this holding deposit is returned to the buyer once the transaction has completed however in this case, we were instructed to follow the following script

- buyer agrees to buy a property for let’s say £500,000

- £5,000 - £10,000 deposit is requested to be held in the estate agents account as commitment to buy the property 

- the buyer is told that the deposit amount will come off the official purchase price and that we will deduct the deposit off of our fee so that the seller technically gets the deposit. 

- the seller is only ever put forward an offer that is less the deposit amount, so in this instance £490,000

- £490,000 goes on the contract and is sold this way as technically the buyer doesn’t pay any purchase tax on the £10,000 .

- the sale completes, the seller gets £490,000, the buyer is none the wiser and the estate agents keeps the £10,000 on top of the fee paid by the seller. 



We were disciplined if we did not agree this deposit scheme with every sale and we we’re not given any incentive to partake in this illegal activity. The directors of the company benefitted from this scam. 

Over the course of the 4 years that I worked there, the company must have taken in excess of £400,000 worth of these deposits. 

Thankfully, I’ve moved onto much greener pastures , but apparently the company is still partaking in this practice to date. 

Lesson to learn, 
If you are paying a deposit when you buy a property, make sure the seller knows directly from you what price you have agreed to pay , the middleman could be benefitting instead!",2022-08-24 16:43:40

For context, we'll call the guy ""Jake"". Jake was a heavy-set kid, pretty obese. I wasn't skinny by any means myself either. My elementary school got tired of loud cafeterias so they assigned seats for every student and you weren't allowed to get up either and they wouldn't let kids move their seats. They would constantly get kids asking to be moved (near their friends) so the response was always no. Jake would constantly take everything on his lunch tray into a mound and mix it and eat it that way.

Every meal he'd make this disgusting concoction no matter what it was, including his chocolate milk it'd go on top irregardless of what it was it was always appalling and stomach turning. There would be times when I'd get so disgusted by Jakes eating habits that I couldn't eat. One day in the cafeteria I felt sick to my stomach, my dad didn't let me skip school and the smell of food let alone the sight of it was making me nauseous and I couldn't get them to let me leave or make me not be in the cafeteria for lunch. I looked at Jake, and said ""Can you PLEASE not do your typical lunch concoction for once? Just not today, please I never ask this of you but I feel like I'm going to puke."" He smiled at me, turned to his tray, and started pouring his apple sauce and his chocolate milk on his pizza. I got furious, stood up, and hocked the juiciest loogie right onto his tray with the most obvious noise I could do. People sitting at my table were either shocked or applauding me. I got sent to the Principles office and got sent to detention and ridiculed! He balled his eyes out and I had to pay for his new school lunch!

Got Drunk and Talked Bad About a Former Colleague to their Investors,28,ww8f06,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ww8f06/got_drunk_and_talked_bad_about_a_former_colleague/,7,1661310995.0,"Bit of context- I started my career in a pretty junior capacity (wasn't qualified for anything else) in a start up and pretty quickly worked my way up to more responsibility, eventually taking a senior leadership role in the business.  There was a foreign guy (let's call him John) who was deployed in from overseas by investors about the same age as me who I felt was sort of gifted a parallel job to the one  I had worked pretty hard to earn.  Always had a chip on my shoulder since he got to an equivalent position faster, got paid better and most importantly was granted shares in the business when I wasn't.  

The tech community where I live is pretty small.  Over the course of the last 10 years, we've continued to cross paths. We've both done pretty well, and John went on to start a business of his own that got pretty strong investment from prominent VC funds.  I've found myself doing investing now and  am pretty fortunate to find myself in a senior position with access to investors and influential executives in the region we work in. 

Last night, I had been meeting for 3-4 hours with different VCs for drinks (VCs tend to drink a lot). I'm not the most social person, and I tend to like being a little buzzed to help me socialize/network/relationship build.  By about 8:30, I was probably 5-6 drinks deep and met another group of investors that were visiting.    One of them was from a prominent family office that had ties to John's company and was considering re-investing.  Another was from a regional fund that was also exploring an investment in to John's company.   The subject of John's company came up and although I didn't think I was that drunk, I sort of cut loose and talked a lot of shit about John, his work ethic, his business and business model.  

In the morning, I realized that this was really unprofessional and not something I think I would have done (or at least not aggressively) if I was sober.  While I wasn't lying and these are genuinely my honest opinion on John and his business, I feel terrible that I may have disrupted John's relationship with current and potential investors. Equally importantly, think it was really unfair to punch down on someone behind their back and when they're not in a position to defend themselves.  The reality is that John's never explicitly wronged me- I just don't like the guy and I abused my platform to talk badly of him.   I honestly hope my opinion matters little to these people- if only so that it doesn't affect John's reputation too badly, and it doesn't hurt his business or the many people they employ.  I am also close friends with some of John's early investors and supporters - I know that if word gets around about what I said, it would almost certainly badly damage my relationship with these dear friends that are closely involved in John's business.  

Unfortunately, this isn't the first time I've been loose lipped when drunk and said something I regretted (unfortunately also not the first time in a professional setting).  I just want to be a better, more positive person.  I want to feel like I can be successful without tearing other people down.  I'm going to try to slow down on my drinking (maybe even stop for a while) and try to keep this in my head going forward.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",2022-08-24 06:16:35

I was busting my ass to pay for college and my young kid. I know, it already sounds like I’m trying to justify it so just hear me out before you judge. 

I had someone throw up in my car before and it was an awful experience all around. So when I roll up and see that I am at a bar, I was already hesitant. It was the afternoon and bright outside so I thought I’d be fine.

Well, 3 people are approaching the vehicle. Two of them look maybe 50 and the other guy looks past that age where they could be 60 or 100. Genuinely no clue how old the guy could have been. One of the younger 2 is holding the old guys cane and they are both holding one arm helping him walk to and get in the car. He is a combination of very drunk and very old. 

I confirm the address, complete a rather quiet trip, and arrive at his house. Before I get out to help him with the door, he asks how much I owe him. I told him it’s already paid for by his friends at the bar (their account name). Then I get out and walk around to get his door and help him out. He hands me a $20 and said “that should cover it. Right?” I just said “yes” and helped him to his door before moving on. 

Should I have kept it? Maybe. Maybe not. It wasn’t “the right” thing to do even if it wasn’t that bad but I still think about it sometimes. As sad as it is, that was one of the best tips I ever got.",2022-08-23 22:28:08

I then got down on my knees pretending to tie my shoes, then when nobody was looking i grabbed every single one of those cups and ran straight to where you deposit them.

I stole $12 from a kids payment for an excursion and used it for food for me and my friends.,9,wtyfeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/wtyfeb/i_stole_12_from_a_kids_payment_for_an_excursion/,4,1661084861.0,"During this time I was in Year 3. Everyone had to pay $12 for an excursion so they could attend. One day, a boy, (let’s call him Riley) payed his money to the teacher that day. I thought it would be a good idea to steal  this money so I was able to buy heaps of food from the canteen. I stole it and didn’t get caught. 

At lunch, I offered to all my classmates if they wanted something from the canteen cause I could afford anything. They all had something but no one seemed suspicious.

When lunch ended, the teacher asked the class if they had seen the money, no one knew where it went. Not even the kids that I bought food for with EXACTLY $12 dollars. They were oblivious. The teacher mentioned that it was $12 but my classmates never realised that.

In the end, I didn’t get caught. 
I have stolen so much stuff from that classroom, like board games and things.

EDIT: Riley had to pay the money back if he wanted to go on the trip. So he never got to go.",2022-08-21 15:27:41

I feel like a failure. I know other siblings have done worse but I've been the thorn in her side for most of her life and I'm sick of the guilt I've felt all these years just to act like this again. I'm fucking pathetic. I'm an ADULT. 

I hope that all of the little siblings out there know that they are precious and didn't deserve to feel in second place. I'm so sorry, I'm taking steps towards being a better person for her

Edit: We went out, I gave her $100 and told her what I did, she began buying strawberries with the money. I also gave her some of my more girly clothes and she seemed more excited for that somehow. Thanks for all of the comments, I needed to be humbled

edit 2: I came here to repent and undo my damages. I did just that and I'm making steps to better myself. despite her being happy now, the messages I'm receiving are becoming rather damaging, threatening, and I'm beginning to obsess over what I did wrong. thank you all for the advice.

Things that I easily could've bought but for some reason I had the urge to steal them instead. 

I left the place out of sheer guilt for what I've done, and when I left a manager called to tell me they've ""got a file on you"" and to never go back. Our previous LP guy ""joked"" that had a file on me but now I know for sure. Still curious as to why a former manager would call me and tell me, considering I'm a scumbag who stole. I basically would steal once every few months, and every time I'd feel guilty and still to this day Do. Cost for the company wise, maybe less than 1k, but obviously a company doesn't always sell at cost so overall it could be seen as more than 1k lost of potential revenue. 

A place that has all my info readily available I stole from, for no good reason besides some fucked up impulse to do it. For the last 2 weeks I've been unemployed and terrified to apply anywhere else (as I should) since if a new place contacts my former one, they could tell them. I'm also anxiously awaiting what I assume will eventually be a letter from a court and I'm terrified to have a mark on my otherwise clean record. I went to college for criminal justice ffs. 

I can't go to jail or prison, and I don't want that mark on my record even though I deserve it. The fear of my family and friends finding out is absolutely tearing me apart. 

I want to say I'm a good person but I'm not, a good person wouldn't steal. I know I will never EVER steal again, but this guilt will probably follow me to the grave.

He screamed at me, saying “I’m not gay!” Then charged at me, swung me around by grabbing onto my bag, then punched me in the back of my head. he then ran away to his house. I was feeling two main feelings: confusion and shock. I ran after him, told him I’m sorry, then we all went home. 
I got home, thought about it, and then the more I thought about it, the more I got pissed. I was so angry that he attacked me like that, and I really wish that I had punched him back. I was also super angry because he had called me gay a few times before too. We didn’t talk for a few weeks after that. so the way I retaliated is by making fun of him behind his back with Keegan. we never said any of this to him, but we would make fun of him because of his weight, even though I’m the same size as him.

One day Keegan had a few friends over, and all of us hung out outside. It was me, Keegan, our brothers, and the 2 friends, Evan (the older one) and Zach (the younger one) who were also brothers. I told Zach and Evan about Rowan, and they told me I should invite Rowan to the park, because they wanted to see what he looked like. I showed them a picture of him, but they still really wanted to see him in person. So I did. We had talked a little bit before this, so I felt that it was “okay” to do it. So I invited him down to the park, and the six of us walked down there to meet him. Before we got there I told Keegan to call him fat, and I told Evan to call him gay. I was feeling nervous, even though I planned all this like a complete asshole. so when we met him there, they immediately tore into him. I hardly spoke a word to him, while Keegan and Evan said terrible things while we hung out with him and talked- “Why are you so fat?” “You’re gay.” “Does the ground shake when you jump?” They said nasty things, most of which I didn’t even tell them to say. I told Keegan and Evan to stop because I was already regretting this. But they didn’t stop. They kept going. Then eventually Rowan went home. I felt like a piece of garbage. It was one of the lowest things I had ever done. It’s one of my biggest regrets in my life.

Me and him didn’t talk for about a month, until one day I called him to see if he wanted to play an online game. So we did, and we didn’t speak a word about it. We acted like nothing happened. I would like to apologize, but I also wonder if he had forgotten about it. He had no idea that I told Keegan and Evan to do that.

This bar/restaurant was extremely focused on revenue above all else, and even went so far as to record how much in sales each server made each night. There weren’t any tangible rewards for being the best salesperson, aside from managerial recognition, compliments and sometimes a free glass of our house wine.

Anyway, throughout my life I’ve always been driven by perfectionism and a longing to stand out, especially in professional situations. I’m also very lucky to have been born to parents who own and manage their own highly successful and independent financial consultancy business. Thus money has never been an object in my life. Even with this part-time job, I was mainly doing it for the addition to my LinkedIn timeline than the wages.

This all compounded into me striving to be the top wine seller every shift. Our main selling objective was to sell bottles of wine for guests to take away as they leave the bar. At first I would use common sales tactics, having listened to a colossal amount of hours of sales training podcasts and reading books on influencing people. This worked, to an extent. But often I found that whatever I said to the customers, they simply weren’t in the mood to buy wine after having spent a lot on a full meal and drinks.

So to improve my sales figures, I told some white lies. I still can’t decide if this was unethical or not. When I handed certain guests their check I would write on the back “please buy a bottle of our house wine and leave this check on the table with your PayPal address written on it, I need to make more sales so as not to be fired and will reimburse you after my shift TYSM :)”, then left the bill and pen on the table, along with a $5 bill to show I was serious. Most of the time the guests hastily left the bar wine-less, giving me a strange look. But some of them took pity on my self-fabricated situation and bought some wine - and true to my word, I reimbursed them.

After a couple of months doing this routine, I left the job to focus more on my studies. I left with far less income than my colleagues, but with a reference letter stating that I was an incredibly skilled salesperson and the best the company’s seen, which certainly helped in my future endeavours.",2022-08-15 18:32:09

This friend, let's call him Liam, was much older than me and got kicked out of the school I was in due to other reasons. Story for another time. Anyways, I kinda idolized Liam for being older and I thought anything he did I should do too since, as mentioned before, I was a dumb kid. The school just so happened to put up a sign, saying, ""\_\_\_\_\_\_ School"" and it was very beautiful, I really liked it. But, our friend Liam didn't. And he decided to replace ""School"" with ""Ass"". I know, very mature. I wanted to look cool in front of him. So he wrote the letter A, I wrote the rest, we heard a car coming and ran for our lives. Got away scot free, laughed about it, happy ending. Or so I though. Next week, (My school likes to call all classes to one big room to make announcements) I hear the principal say to the whole school that he saw two kids in hoodies running away and when he looked at the sign, he saw my dirty work. He said that he was really disappointed that this happened, and that he expects better from all of us, big lecture. I forget exactly what he said but I felt super guilty. And, it just so happened that my sister goes to the same school I was in. And it just so happened she saw me and Liam graffiti other walls near my house in black ink.

when I was a child (7 or 8 years old),  we had a boiler system working with gas that permit us to have hot water at home. The gas was also used to run the gas stove for cooking. 

I remember that this boiler was in the kitchen, in height but everybody could reach it easily with a chair. 

It had a small ""window"" where you could see flames constantly lit. I assumed that if the flames lit, then it means that the boiler is working. 

One evening, we were watching an episode of ""Deal or not deal ». I was obsessed with the contestants who opened the boxes. My older sisters told me that the boxes were sealed with wire and candle wax. 

I really wanted to be like the contestants and make my own boxes. So I got my wires ready and found a candle at home but I didn't have a lighter or match. 

Another thing: our apartment was not big enough for my sisters and I and we shared our bedroom. And one of them, super studious, often studied in the kitchen so as not to be disturbed by the noise. 

Anyway. 

That night, I didn't have a lighter to melt my candle wax. I immediately thought of the boiler with its little flames that appear behind the ""window"". So I climbed on a chair but instead of lighting the candle, I lit a sheet of paper. The paper caught in fire quickly, and the flames of the boiler that used to be « normal » were bigger when i touched them with the paper.  I panicked and I was afraid that my sister would die bc of me (???) because the boiler was different than it used to be. So I blew hard and the fire as I’m trying to turn it off and put water on it. It put out the flame of the boiler which was normally always burning when it works. 

In the morning, my sisters complained that the hot water was not working. We were in the middle of winter, not very rich at that time by the way. 

My father did not understand the problem and how the boiler just shut down all of a sudden while it normally works perfectly fine since forever. He also could not imagine that someone touched the boiler. And especially not me, a 7 years old child. 

So he was forced to change the whole system, to switch to heating water with a hot water tank that works with electricity and he had to cut off the gas at home. 

He had to buy a hot water tank and a new gas stove. 

20 years later, this secret haunts me even if everything is fine now at home and we are a little richer (we were really poor at the time.) moreover , now that I’m an adult and live alone, I know how much thoses things are expansive  !! And felt ever more bad to think that my dad had to find a solution while we didn’t have a lot of money, to find a solution because it’s almost a « vital » problem.  

I bought my parents a lot of things (furniture, appliances, etc.) to make up for it, even though they don't know that it was ME who damaged the system. 

I’m feel a little bit better to confess the biggest secret of my life to people.",2022-08-14 20:03:10

After a few times once, I started roaming the house and peeking in medicine cabinets and cupboards how I might have done a few years ago. I was relieved when I didn’t actually find anything and went about my business. After a few more visits I started poking around their kitchen and stumbled across a pill bottle way up high. Oxycodone from my father in-laws hip surgery. These were prescribed in March and this was July. I counted 25 so I knew they hadn’t been touched and that they wouldn’t be. I put them back and thought about the guilt I knew I would feel if I took any. I thought about the worry of being found out and everything that goes with stealing pain pills from someone you love. I haven’t taken pain pills in a couple of years after abusing my own prescription and having to then use suboxone for 4 years and weening myself off of that. (Now I’m addicted to Kratom- recommended by a therapist). After putting them up in the cupboard I had a sense of relief and was proud of myself because in the old days, I would have been sick to my stomach thinking about missing this opportunity to actually feel good for awhile. I walked away and when I came back through the kitchen, I threw open the cupboard and pulled out six pills. They were only 5mg and even though it’s been a long time I knew it might not do much. So, I took two spoons and crushed them. I used a rolled up twenty and sniffed them up my nose in the bathroom in a coral bowl. It was a lot of powder. It took a long time and totally messed up my sinuses for awhile. I can’t say I felt much of anything which was disappointing but expected. Now I’m having all the stressful, awful thoughts I knew I would. Completely not worth it. I’m close to confessing to them and I know they would forgive me. The problem is, I think they’d feel obligated to convince me to tell my wife. After everything I’ve put her through- She wouldn’t understand and I would lose her trust for good this time. It would hurt her and strain our marriage. We have grown so much and are closer than we’ve been in years. I don’t want to lose that.  Yes, I should have thought of that before I did it. I guess even after all this time, I’m still a piece of shit. I’m not worried about continuing on with this. I haven’t done it again and I’m not about to start using drugs again- it’s not like that.

When we went home, I didn't even eat the whole thing and threw about half of the block in the trash. I never did anything like this ever again.
I genuinely feel bad about this, because I am not really a rule breaker and feel guilty for stealing and wasting food. It has been on my conscience for years now. I have never told anyone about this, feels good to get it off my chest.

My son invited us to visit at his home and stay for dinner. He lives alone in this huge house (from my standards) and that idea led me through this train of thought about security. As well as keeping an eye on everything in the house because my wife works for a home security company. We were short on money that month and while my wife was talking with our son, I found his wallet and I looked inside. There was a total of $150, give or take a few. I took a total of $70 from his wallet and went back to the room they were talking in.

i (16F) just got back from a summer trip. two days before this trip, i got my license. i spent those two days driving around and enjoying my license as much as i could before i left. 
fast forward two months, and im back home. i was super excited to start driving again because it’s honestly something i’ve been looking forward to for a long time, especially because i’m a pretty independent person and i love spending time outside of home. so i decided to pull a basic white girl (edit: i feel that i should add and specifically state that i am a basic white girl. i like to cope with a little self-deprecating humor, but there’s nothing w being white or basic. just weeding out future replies) and drive to starbucks to get my favorite order. 
now, my car usually is parked right outside the door to my house, but because we left home, it was parked all the way down my driveway near a little wooded area. i think you can guess where this is going to go.

when i got into my car and went into reverse, i realized my moms car was right behind mine. so i turned the wheel to make sure i didn’t hit my moms car and it worked for a little bit until my car went into a complete stop. this is when i realized the right side of my car was completely covered by trees. i panicked a bit, drove forward, reversed again, and there was the same result. i decided to be a little more rough and change the angle and i was able to leave. when i got out of my driveway, i immediately went to check if my car was damaged and i didn’t see anything so i just went on with my way. one day later we’re packing up to go to a road trip and my dad yells my name and tells me to come over to where he’s standing.

that’s when i see it. a medium sized dent right on top of my right headlight. god when i saw that i felt my world collapsing around me. i’ve always been such a responsible kid and i’ve never hit y car when i had my permit, nor had i even almost crashed my car. i regret having that starbucks craving. i knew something bad was gonna happen, i should’ve just stayed at home.

this isn’t the worst part. when he asked how i crashed it, my body naturally felt defensive and i lied. i said i didn’t know and that i didn’t notice until he brought it up so it must’ve been dented while my car was parked at the starbucks, which is a lie by itself because i never even left my car in the starbucks since i used the drive thru. 

we’re gonna repair it but i think my mom knows something is wrong because she started saying how it’s okay to crash your car when you’ve just started driving  and that maybe i hit it by a wall and didn’t know, even adding her personal experiences crashing her car into inanimate objects without noticing. however, my dad wants me to call the starbucks and ask for footage.

the only way out is to tell the truth, but i know they’re gonna be pissed if they find out i lied.

is there anything else i can do other than just tell the truth?
please try to be respectful in the replies

UPDATE: i told my dad the truth in a chipotle. he smiled and said he knew i lied but there was no point in doing so. i told him the full story, and he didn’t seem mad at all, just slightly disappointed, but he smiled which is a good sign. he’s proud of me for telling the truth, though. thanks everyone for the advice!",2022-08-08 18:33:41

After our lessons on sinning and doing bad stuff, I developed the idea that my friend (let's call her Lilly) was lying about her peanut allergy and just didn't like peanut butter but was too ashamed to tell me because they were my favorite snack at the time. Not to mention the times when someone would bring in a snack for the class and we'd always have to check if they had peanuts in them. If they did, the whole class couldn't eat them so that she wouldn't feel left out. I was tired of what I thought was a dumb, made-up lie and decided to take matters into my own hands by bringing a big jar of peanut butter and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Once it's snack break I waited until Lilly went to the bathroom to take out my peanut butter jar to slip a spoonful into her cup, shaking it good so she wouldn't suspect a thing. Once she came back, she sat down and drank some of her peanut butter infused water. As she did so I watched with wide eyes making sure to take in every detail, now convinced that she's been lying the whole time. Suddenly, Lilly started coughing uncontrollably, choking and thrashing herself all over the floor. It also didn't help that she forgot her epipen at home that day, causing her to convulse and forcing my teacher to call an ambulance. It turned out she was severely allergic to peanut butter and I never had the gull to tell her what I had done that day. We're still friends today and she strongly believes that her father was trying to kill her that day since she got in a fight with him the day before regarding her dead mother.",2022-08-02 23:43:28
I stole a total amount of nearly 1000$ during my 10th grade and made one student got kicked out of the school,50,we8awh,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/we8awh/i_stole_a_total_amount_of_nearly_1000_during_my/,25,1659436668.0,"Back in 2013, I wanted a PC that is strong enough to play GTA V. I am a huge GTA fan back then so it's obvious I would want a strong PC. But I have no money and my parents wouldn't buy me one. Then I had this thought.

My classroom was another classroom away from the bathroom so whenever the other class has a gym class I would sneak into their classroom and search the bags of the students for money that they brought for snacks when the day ends. Of course, I have to ask the teacher to go to the bathroom to avoid suspicions. At the very first day of attempting the plan, I stole about 10 bucks.

I kept doing this for months and I gathered an amount of almost 1000 bucks. I didn't remember exactly how much was it because I bought a new PC like I've said before.

But I am very conscious about my repetitive asking for bathroom. So I only do that once every 2 weeks or whenever the school schedule changed. One time, I found this an envelope on the teacher's table. I obviously stole it but not opening it in order something bad happens. I was so nervous that day because I know that only a large amount of money would be kept inside an envelope. That envelope was compensation money from another student. I also heard that there was some kid kicked a soccer ball too hard it broke a classroom's window and a pot plant that lies right in front of that window so I guess the money was huge

And on the next day, my homeroom teacher mentioned about the missing of that envelope of the classroom I always do the dirty works in. I was sweating when she mentioned it but it turned out to be okay, at least for me.

So, at the same day I stole the envelope, there was another kid going back to her class right after i went back to my class so she was suspected. I heard that thing but not clearly so I just thought that that kid lost her envelope which she has to give it to her teacher. So at the same day, I snuck into that class afterwards.

And on the same day, the homeroom teacher of that class decided to check her bag and immediately found the envelope. I did not know about that until several days later one of my friends told me that due to her ""stealing"" the teacher's envelope she was expelled.

I have basically willingly become the shittiest biker on purpose just to piss people off. I often go in wavy lines, never tell which way I am turning, often stop for literally no fucking reason, constantly violate traffic laws for shits and giggles, and even occasionally act completely drunk just to drive home my point.

I enjoy doing this as they have no power here. They are constantly on edge because they know if they hit me damn well they are going to be at fault since im just a 14 year old just tryin to get some damn cream soda at the local russ's or just tryin to get a damn runza sandwich.

I basically exist for the sole point of terrorizing drivers nowadays. 5 hours of my day are just trolling poor bastards on highway 2. I even remember multiple cases of certain regular drivers changing their routes or just straight up quitting driving just because of me.

Its gotten to the point where I had a rival Ram 2500 truck driver constantly yelling at me which I would reply with the thickest irish accent while cursing at him the most vile shit no one had said since the 1580s.

He’s yelling while I’m typing this

He really started getting bad around a year ago. He got diagnosed with aplastic amenia, bone marrow failure, and extremely low blood counts. Most of his blood counts are under 30. Lately, he’s had hallucinations and extreme outbursts of anger. We never know what day he’s gonna have. If it’s a bad day consider it ruined. He’s always been kinda like this but these past few months it’s been worse.

His personality is worse than his health. Extreme anger issues, selfish, and just down right evil sometimes. He won’t help you unless he gets a treat. When friends of anyone come over he immediately asks if they got anything for him and if they didn’t he gets mad and stomps around, demanding when they come back to have something for him.

Extreme anger that we couldn’t do anything about. He’s immune to melatonin or any other sleep med we can put him on. Him screaming I’ll kill you and get the fuck out of my house is the worst part. 

It was about 1 or 2 am I was woken up by him growling so loud it was vibrating the walls. My room is right above his.  

I went down there and he just got more mad when I said to be more quiet. The second time I went down there it was just over. I opened his door, yelled at him to shut the fuck up and swiped off all the stuff on his desk. I also destroyed a dinner plate.

Mom came down and asked what the hell was going on so I just went to my room and stayed up. Her and my grandpa spent the night tryna calm him down. I was left alone. I regret breaking part of his room but I meant what I said. He needs to be put in a mental hospital or a home.",2022-07-27 01:32:08

My sister laughed and mentioned how my mom asked my sister “(My name) wouldn’t be the type to scratch a car and run off… right?” And I panicked a bit. I really wish I stayed in the lot and told the person “I’m sorry for scratching your car, I can pay for it” or something. I don’t wanna tell my mom because it’s in the past and I lied to her. I’m used to keeping secrets from her about my personal life, but I just feel so much regret and guilt, I hope the person whose car I scratched is ok. Sorry if there is typos and grammar errors, I’m usually good at writing but its 4 am and I’m stressed, not super religious but I might pray before I go to bed idk.",2022-07-26 10:57:49
I broke my son's action figure while playing with it and blamed his younger brother,161,w81b47,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/w81b47/i_broke_my_sons_action_figure_while_playing_with/,30,1658785700.0,"Basically what the title says. My 8-year-old son has a large collection of wrestling action figures and I've been secretly playing with them when the house has been empty for a few months now. I used to play with wrestling figures all the time as a kid and only gave it up because I felt like I was supposed to. Then a few months ago I started working from home. During a lunch break I went into his room for something and got caught up examining his collection. Before I knew it, I was playing with them just as I did as a kid. Now it's become a daily tradition for me. Every lunch break, I go into his room and have a few matches. It's been a great stress relief and I genuinely love making my own storylines just as I did as a kid.

Anyway, he has this John Cena figure that he uses all the time and, as it happens, so do I. Hey, it's Cena. Am I seriously not going to have him competing? So today I was using that figure in a match and the arm just snapped off. I'm sure I was being careful with it, but I suppose it's just the result of wear and tear. I had hoped I could get to the store and replace the figure before he noticed, but no such luck. He picked up on it literally the moment he got home. I panicked and blamed it on his 6-year-old brother, who finishes school a few hours earlier than he does. He bought it, but my wife knows it doesn't add up. That kid has his own toys and zero interest in wrestling. On top of that, we always make sure he eats and does his homework after coming in from school, so playtime for him is only starting when my oldest son comes home. 

So what should I tell her? She suspects it was me but obviously thinks I just dropped the figure while tidying his room or something. Do I tell a half-truth and play along with that version of events? Or do I tell her what really happened and hope she doesn't think of me as some type of man child? I make a plenty of money at work and am pretty well-rounded in all aspects of my life, I just like to let off steam by playing with wrestling figures. I'm probably gonna tell her. Is that the right move?

Update!

So it didn't actually occur to me to post an update but I bascially told my wife about what happened almost immediately after I posted this and she... LAUGHED HER ASS OFF. I haven't seen her laugh like that in a long time and it was the most beautiful sight. I can't believe I ever even considered not telling her. She told me she didn't care what I do to relieve stress and said that, if anything, this makes her love me even more. 

We agreed to replace the Cena figure, tell our oldest I accidentally broke it when cleaning his room, and then give both kids a nice haul of new toys. She even suggested I start to my own collection to avoid this happening again, which is a good idea. We'll all head to the toy store tomorrow, so suggestions for a cute little figure I can buy for her would be appreciated. She has no interest in that kind of stuff, but she'd definitely find it funny. I love her. 

I also loved the input I got here, a few people said the childish thing wasn't playing with toys but lying to my son. You were right. Anyway, peace!",2022-07-26 00:48:20

I'm pretty sure everyone thought he was drunk or tired. My father was doing homework with me ( they still hadn't divorced)  My dad was typing on his phone, he didn't answer me when I asked him a question. I peeked to see what was so interesting. I wish I hadn't, I saw messages, he was texting another woman. I told my mother and told her to keep it a secret, but while arguing she let it slip. After my father questioned my brother and I. I lied and at the end the blame was put on my brother, he was frustrated at me because it was all my fault and I got scot-free. for the next 6-10 months my brother was constantly reminded of the texts by my dad still thinking it was him. I knew my father was cheating. Right after the divorce my dad got a girlfriend everyone thought it was weird including his sisters. During the divorce my mother got texts from my dad's girlfriend the texts usually went on the lines of ""Divorce him already!"" or ""You're a b\*tch"" We could never trace the number so we never had proof. My dad divorced the same time his girlfriend did. They got married immediately. Soon we found out they had been dating for over a year, it explained the quick marriage, they expect a new child. I'm overwhelmed these  years have went to fast, I can't even remember those years really well. My dad and his wife are both cheaters and I will never tell my half brother because he doesn't need to know, I don't want him to think he was only born because of cheaters. it's going to Only be between my mother my brother and I. I hope my half-brother never finds out about it. Because I don't want him to become depressed. I still feel bad for my brother but I don't have the confidents to tell my father it was me. Although my stepmom and dad treat me well in the back of my mind I'm constantly reminded of the texts, a little kiss emoji, I can't get it out my mind, the shock I felt. The divorce made the years go fast and I'm missing two years of my life. My dad is always trying to make my mother's life harder and she still gets text, always in Japanese just for her, I don't know if its my dad or my stepmom, but honestly I think its both of them. If I ever find who sends those messages my hands will be bloody.

Edit: after showing all the comments she really appreciates it, she said she’s not perfect. She said sometimes they would fight, but I think this is wrong, every relation has fights and after they both make up to it fighting is part of a relationship and you should expect it. I don’t mean that you should fight everyday, but once every few months is fine, we are human. There will always be a problem, no one is perfect. There will always be a flaw. I thank you guys for the support, I will make it up with my brother and continue to support my mother, she appreciates the comments, I had to read it to her, she lived 30 years in Japan and can’t fluently read. I thank you for the support and taking time on giving me advice, I hope all of you have a goodnight/morning. I just join the community and it’s been really heartwarming, I love you all. 


Edit 2: I thought it was the end but today at 5AM(August 9th) she showed me that someone has made a fake account acting as my mother, why? Why are they harassing my mother, the divorce is done and they got what they want. I know it’s them. This is the type of shit they do, when my half brother gets older I wonder how he will act. I hope it’s not like them. They even put a PFP which was the biggest giveaway it was from my father or my step-mother.

As a kid I was obsessed with the family dollar down the street from my house but I never had any money. So I decided to take my grandmothers credit card and but whatever I wanted but then buy cleaning supplies to distract her from what I really went to buy. 

So I would bring everything home then I would leave the toys I bought in my old stroller outside the door of my house since we lived in a apartment building. 

I would come in with the cleaning supplies and she'd ask ""Where did you get all this from?"" And I say ""Oh well since I was the hundred customer at family dollar they let me get whatever I want for an entire month"" then before she could say anything else I would hold the bags up and she'd be in complete aw of how I got all this stuff for her.

I would go back outside the door and sit down, since I always played with my toys in the hallway of the building she didn't think of it as anything especially since the door was open and she could hear me, then when I was done playing I would leave them in my stroller so I could ""randomly"" find them.

The toy was one small metal disc thingy that you could find in packs of croissants or biscuits (I did some research on what it was and the closest thing I got to is ""slammers""). In each pack you could find one toy like that and it would have a different rarity. The normal one's would be made of some cardboard like material(idk how to exactly describe it) and there would be a small chance of the toy being metal. 
I remember we were in school and absolutely every boy would be playing and collecting those toys. We would basically put them side down and would try to slam them over to take them. One of the kids had one of the rare metal ones and would destroy everyone with it.
I was standing on the desk behind him and one time the teacher called him over and he left his stuff unaccounted for. I saw the moment and snatched his metal one. He returned to his seat and in break time was looking everywhere for it (each one had a character on it and these ones had the teenage mutant ninja turtles on it more specifically Leonardo). 
I returned home. Took out the stolen item. I was so happy. It was my first metal disk. After that everytime I saw him I would think of the shitty action I did. We had a fight couple of months later and he broke my tooth so now I have a fake one that always reminds me of him and the stupid toy.
This was the first and last time I stole something and it STILL haunts me to this day. I don't know what to do to rid my soul of this. I feel cursed with guilt. All over a dumb toy.",2022-07-24 21:06:05

I got literally straight Fs during my fourth year. I had felt very miserable and isolated during COVID, and I just couldn’t finish any assignments. I was also an average student to start with prior to COVID, so my GPA really couldn’t take those hits. I couldn’t find another major that would admit me at the time due to incredibly low GPA. As of now I am working on getting readmitted back into college with an anthropology major. If I can get readmitted, I would be able to graduate by the end of 2022.  

When I found out last spring, I told my parents that I won’t be graduating on time due to not finishing all my required classes. I did not tell them about being kicked out of my major and college. I told them I would be graduating by spring 2022. They were not happy about it. They may have even suspected that I have been lying the whole year because honestly I have been acting quite out of character. I have been depressed and isolated. I also don’t think I’m a particularly good liar. They have asked me multiple times about the status of my degree throughout this year, and I think they know I am lying. Now, it’s nearly 4 months since spring and I am supposed to be a able to pick up my diploma soon. They know of this. My mom has been asking me very intently about it. 

My original plan was that I could have a fake diploma mailed to my house and avoid the trip to the administration’s office to pick up my nonexistent diploma. But I know my mom would probably prefer to come with me to the office. I have gone as far as making a fake diploma recently. Whilst ordering it, I felt my soul withering away with guilt but continued with it. 

I have just now received the fake diploma, and it looks inconsistent with the real diploma as I expected. The seal is wrong, and the signatures are obviously inaccurate. The paper is also more yellow than I think it’s supposed to be. 

I wasn’t thinking that I would actually be able to hand that diploma in to my parents anyways. I just needed to see it in my hands to realize how bad and far I have gone with this lie. I think it would be much worse to hand that fake diploma to my parents than if I were to come out clean now. I will have to come clean in the next week or so. It will be hell. I don’t know if I have enough courage at all to say anything. I think more realistically, they’ll have to pressure it out of me as they pester about the diploma over the next couple of weeks. I have no clue what would happen after. I will have to carry this shame with me for the rest of my life. My parents and I do not communicate well ever. They are Asian parents who have high expectations. 

I know I dug my own hole, and I deserve every bit of this. I will need to work so hard to get my life back together that at this point, I just don’t think I can do it. I have been doing so terribly throughout COVID and then worse during the last year that I feel like there’s almost no return. I don’t have enough strength to continue. My parents won’t ever be proud of me. I just want to disappear. 

I need advice. I need courage to continue. Please help.

Edit: I would really appreciate any response from parents about how you think you’d react if your children were in my shoes. Thank you.",2022-07-24 04:42:53

I was very gullible and I never got out much cause I went to a private school. I had a friend very close to me and we would usually talk everyday. We had this program called afterschool link and we would pretty much stay after school and learn new things, eat, do homework, play, or just wait for our parents to pick us up afterschool. There were most kids there but really I would stay here very late with this particular girl that I was close to. One day we had learned about these disorders such as, Down Syndrome, Tourettes Syndrome, and Dyslexia. After me and her had learned about what these syndromes do to people that have them we really could not stop thinking about them. Me and her walked to our gym time to do things in the gym like dodgeball and such. Instead of participating in the sports we decided to sit out and talk about these disorders, specifically Tourettes. I also forgot to mention we had watched videos on how these affected people. We started to show each other examples on how the tics in the videos were shown. Pretty much we started thinking it was fun and wouldn't stop doing it. The teacher hadn't stopped us or anything so we thought it was OK. We started telling each other how we had different tics like mobile tics or general tics, just making up names for different kinds of tics that affected us like the way we walk or talk.

I have no idea what a little 8 year old did to make everyone hate him, but hell I managed it. I especially hated this one girl. I'll call her Emily. Everyone in my school was unreasonably mean, but god Emily was a complete douche. She'd make fun of my weight, said I was too lame for sports (i have severe asthma, so I literally cant participate in sports), would spread just really gross rumors about me and that was just so much an 8 year old could handle. I couldn't cry about it in school either because she'd make fun of me because 'boys cant cry'. 
I grew up dealing with my anger differently than others, so instead of screaming into a pillow or crying or anything like that- I decided to physically harm her. I mean that basically counts as assault. 

So on one day before getting on the bus, I quickly snuck an egg into my backpack. A raw egg. I dont know how it didn't break but I successfully managed to bring the egg to school without it breaking in my bag. When I got there, I had to wait for the teacher to leave so I wouldn't get caught. She left to go to the bathroom, and almost immediately, I threw the egg at Emily. The egg hit her directly on the back of the head and shattered, and that shit must've hurt cus she screamed and started sobbing. When the teacher asked who did it I wasn't a dumbass and didnt say me, and luckily nobody saw me do it. They were all reading books and didnt notice me. The teacher was gonna end up talking to everyone to figure out who did it, and an 8 year old is only so good at lying.
I raised my hand, and said word for word,
""Matthew did it. I saw him take an egg out of his pocket and throw it at emily.""
Matthew started panicking and crying cus he didn't do shit, and 8 year old me was trying so hard not to burst out laughing. Matthew got suspended for two weeks, and to this day, nobody knows that it was me who threw that egg. 
I did this when I was 8. I'm now 22 and married. Not even my husband knows about this. I've kept this information for 14 years and haven't told a soul. Whenever I think about this I start uncontrollably laughing and I needed to tell someone about this cus it's hilarious",2022-07-21 08:50:28

I remember my teacher was asking me a question and I didn't really understand her 'cause her voice was echoing, I said ""what?"" She said it again but I didn't understand her so she asked someone else. Through that whole period I was doodeling on my paper and spacing out until the bell rang.

Before her ed came around, during my ed euphoria stage i told one of my friends about what i was doing after she had (half)joked about starvingherself as she hated her body.

I live in a large city, with a guardian. As such, it is very rare for me to be supervised when going out into the city itself. Due to school and financial issues, the only time for me to really indulge in my hobbies is on the weekend. On weekends, I dress in appropriate clothing and go out into the city. When I say appropriate clothing, I mean that the place where I live is quite cold for most of the year, so most people wear large coats and the like while going out. My height is slightly less than average, but not noticeably so, and the clothing that I wear is picked for its distinct plainness and suitability in fitting in. When out in the city, I generally wander for an hour or so before selecting wherever it is I wish to follow on that particular day. It could be a single individual, a couple or even a large group. Once selected, they are then followed for any period of time. Unless they happen to catch some sort of transport or are about to wander into an isolated location, I can follow them for up to 2 hours at a time. After the exercise is concluded, I go home and immediately write down everything I know about these people, such as their location, the clothes they were wearing and if in the case of a group, how many groups exist inside of a larger group. I choose to handwrite this, out of some sort of romanticism. This information is then put away, and I don't look at it much unless I want to edit or add something I have thought of during the week. I don't think this is honestly really that bad, since I'm not hurting anyone, nor am I damaging any relationships of mine by obsessing over this. I've not done it for like two months though, so I think it's getting better.",2022-07-18 01:58:55

I worked at autobarn and said someone shoplifter just to see how the would handle it,26,w136zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/w136zi/i_worked_at_autobarn_and_said_someone_shoplifter/,5,1658048734.0,"Sorry it's freezing and my thumbs can't type 
Title correct**** 
I worked at autobarn and said someone shoplifted to see how they would handle it

**************

I was much younger late teens/ early 20s and was the check out chick at autobarn. 

I had a boss named Gary. He was very particular and super strict. everyone had to stay within their allocated area, we weren't allowed to talk to eachother unless it was helping out a customer. Let's just say the morale fucking sucked. There was a guy called Preston. 
Preston was one of those employees that took his job a little too seriously. He had no time for fun or banter, little life outside of work, a little bit uphimself and angry, but deep down you could tell he was sweet and sensitive. He used to tell me off at times but he had no authority over me and part of me thought he just needed to relax a bit. 

I used to get told off if I walked over to the shelf Infront of the counter. I had to stand all day in one spot with a strict 30 minute break. Tbh most mornings the shop would only have a few people walk in. Watching wood chopping on the store t.v and sketching pretending to do orders was how I got by. Super boring but it did have its perks.

Anyway, one day Preston was in his moody Monday moods. He was getting things done but had no time for anyone to have chit chat. He was giving me the run down how the store has had some shoplifters and I had to keep an extra close eye out. 

Well.. I got curious. See when Preston was giving me the whole spiel about how to catch a shoplifter, he never let on about how they handle one. And when he said 'just let me know if you see anything, even if it might seem like an over reaction/nothing' I decided I had an opportunity for things to be interesting that day. 

A couple of hours later a lanky lad walks in. Trackies, hoodie, big beanie and everything was baggy. I thought bingo. This is my guy. 
He was over at the lights and then walked over to the tools. Tbh he was a little suss looking which is why I thought bingo, but I didn't see him take anything. He put his hand in his pocket and I thought this was my opportunity to prank Preston. 
I walked over and whispered 'Preston I think this guy might have put something in his pocket but I'm not 100%'. Well Preston started walking over to him before he heard the 'but I'm not 100%' and fully interrogated this guy. 
I felt like I made a mistake immediately. This was poor choice of entertainment, I should have stuck to the wood chopping. But Preston was going at him. It was pretty juicy but the guilt was horrible. 'lift up your shirt I know you have something, show me your pockets, what are you here to take?' grabbing his arm. 
This guy looks like a deer in headlights he was so scared and was adamantly saying 'mate I swear I didn't. I'm just looking' then Preston brought me into it 'the girl at the counter said you did' 
Honestly it was like eating the popcorn watching it unfold but then sinking into your chair feeling. I said 'Preston I think I might have been wrong, I just saw his hand in his pocket, I'm sorry' 

Well another thing about Preston is he doesn't like being wrong and he was so invested about this, he didn't care what I said. 
'Give it to me mate. I'll call the cops' 
Gary then walks over. 

'Fuck' I thought. This had gone too far. While also having the realisation that this store actually has no real shoplifting procedure and the way Preston was reacting was wayyyyy inappropriate. 

Gary starts to interrogate him, 'are you sure you don't want to tell us anything?' 
I felt so bad for this guy at this point. 
'Gary I think I'm wrong, I wasn't 100% I just saw his hand went into his pocket at tools but he could have just been fixing his pants or putting his hand in his pocket' 

Gary gets him to take out his pocket. Nothing there so they both look like idiots and let him go. Neither of them apologise to him, just say they were doing their job. I walked over and apologised though. I felt terrible. 

After he left Preston walks over 'he did take something I know it, what did you see?'
'I said before that i wasn't 100%, there was nothing in his pockets. But you said to tell you anything even if it might be an over reaction' Preston then scoffed. 

'So, how are we supposed to handle shoplifters?' I asked
'We call the cops' 
'Maybe we should we have done that then?'
Preston then looks at me with a dead blank face and walks off. 

I feel horrible for the guy.and I know I was wrong. Buttttt it did make work go quicker that day.",2022-07-17 12:05:34

Realizing that I'm the problem and coming to terms with what comes after that.,1095,w0wofz,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/w0wofz/realizing_that_im_the_problem_and_coming_to_terms/,54,1658024549.0,"Recently I began to realize that I'm the problem. I'm sometimes very aggressive and angry when I'm not heard. I sometimes think that everyone hates me and that I just have to put up with it. I've often wondered what the reason for it was and chalked it up to the world being just a terrible place. Then I realize, I'm acting like a child who does not get his way and acts out. I find it hard to admit my wrongdoing because I feel justified in the thought that I'm doing my best. Am I though? Maybe not, I was reading this book called unfuck your brain and it was talking about how sometimes antisocial behavior stems from a coping mechanism some have developed from dealing with bad situations. I fit the bill, it's comforting to realize that the way I am is due to a lack of self-realization and behaviors that we're burned into my subconscious. I'm young and come from a family where the motto is “I'm older so you must listen to me!” It was hard growing up like that but at what point do I stop blaming the people around me for how my life is. I'm the captain of this ship (me I'm the metaphorical ship) so it's time to steer it back on course. It's both comforting and shameful. Feels like I've put down my sword and admitted defeat, that's not so bad as I once thought it was. Sometimes the best course of action is to stop fighting and assess the reality around you. It's easy to get lost and much harder to get back on the right path.",2022-07-17 05:22:29
My whole life I've been collecting photos of pretty girls,664,w0hviz,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/w0hviz/my_whole_life_ive_been_collecting_photos_of/,230,1657981554.0,"Deleting the photos of pretty girls that i saved and not seeking for it anymore is probably like not eating my favourite food and not listening to music anymore. Basically, taking away my happiness. 

Most people say that they can't live without music, though I agree, but my source of dopamine is quite different. 

I like the illusion of being a pretty girl just like others. 

I'm a stalker my whole life, and it probably ruined me. I don't know if this is be the weirdest thing you'll ever see today, but this is how it goes. 

When i was in pre-school, it was the first time that i saw a pretty girl though i was a girl myself, i feel amazed by how they look and i started comparing them with how i look. I ended up buying the same hair clips as them to look as beautiful as them. I tried copying her resting face so i could think that i look like her. Every single day i can't take my eyes off her. Maybe it was all the insecurity that started all of my misery.

I have a photo that could prove this, it was caught on cam. dm me and i will send it. 

I was basically a stalker. 

When i was 7, i saw a beautiful girl in our neighbourhood. I wanted to be friends with her and i told my brother that i am already friends with someone as beautiful as her even though it's not. I even made up a name so he would believe it. After that, I tried following her everywhere. I took pictures of her. My brother already knows that i really wasn't friends with her but I told him i am going to be friends with her and know her name. I eavesdropped in front of her home, and tried hearing her name from one of her friends and i did. Me and my brother took a pic of her infront of her and she got annoyed. When they were biking, we stopped her and forced her to be friends with us, but that didn't work. So I tried to talk to one of my friends that is friends with her, I convinced my friend to persuade the pretty girl to be friends with me, after she did, I got rejected. I didn't know how to say hi, or ask them how to make friends myself. I was so shy, nervous and anxious. I suffered from social anxiety my entire life.

That didn't stop me from being amazed whenever I see pretty girls. I tried mimicking them and i collected all their photos. 

When I first had social media, looking out for pretty girls photos was the first thing that I did. At the end, I got bullied for my looks, a pretty girl told me that i am so ugly and that I couldn't change it. 

That made me mad and insane. It made me depressed. I was already bullied by my brother, and by everyone in school, but the one who insulted myself first was me and society just confirmed how ugly i am. 

All of my classmates was annoyed by me because I don't talk, and probably because I am so ugly and they can't stand me. Even my teachers insulted me for it. I was so convinced that I am so ugly. I was even voted when I was in 5th grade to be the ugliest person in our room. 

I saved the photos of those pretty girls who rejected me. I couldn't forget them. 

I can't count how many times i saved a pretty girl's pic, now I even have the list of the names of girls that i find too attractive and i saved all their pics. I've been seeking for a new look if I get tired of others. I saved every pretty pics of celebrities that I find pretty, but there are others that people find pretty but for me I find ugly. I became kinda perfectionist of other girl's look. I mimicked all of them and tried to imagine that i look like them. I fancy and admire them, been addicted to them, but at the same time, I am insecure of them. I received dopamine. 

And also, my first crush was a girl. I didn't know that girls was meant for guys when i was 5. But, I had crushes on guys, and I've been obsessed with them. I even saved 2000+ pics of a guy that I've been crushing when I was 12.

I don't know why I do it, and up until now, I don't know. Am I creepy for doing this? But ever since I got rejected by that pretty girl that I wanted to be friends with, I didn't stalk other girls like that anymore, only on social media. I even tell my brother that there is a pretty girl that he could like so I could talk about the pretty girls that i fancy to him. I convince him to like them. 

I imagine deleting all pretty girl's pic on my phone, but i just can't do it. 

I've been envious, my brother envied me at first, I felt down for it, but now i am the envious one. I hated my brother, but now i think i am becoming more like him. Maybe I tried to mimick his behavior so much back then to avoid conflicts and now i already have it. 

My whole life I've been insecure, envious, and had a low self esteem, I envied others who are pretty, who is smart, and even someone who has many friends. I wanted to be friends with others so much that now it caused me social anxiety and preferred to be alone. Rejection from my childhood, from my environment, wounded me so much that i could barely even do anything right now at the age of 17. I regretted every act i done in my whole life, but i just can't get out of it. I am also so afraid of being left behind, like everyone getting ahead but me still stucked in my anxiety. 

If there is one room and everyone is pretty, extroverted, talented, smart, much more better than me and I am the worst one, that would probably be my worst nightmare. I would get anxious by each one of them, maybe even face them with rage, or get pressured by them. I would definitely try my best to be like them that's how i am. I would never ever speak to them, and make them see my true self. 

I only make friends to people that I think are like me, or even worse than me. I'm toxic, and jealous. I remember wanting my friend and her other friend to hate each other so they would only turn to me. I don't hate her other friend, I also want to be friends with them. I don't even know if there is one person that I really considered as friend, or am I just using them for the benefit of having friends. My envy stems a lot from my bestfriends becoming better than me. I am so toxic, I can't stand myself. 

I am so different from other people around me, and they will never ever see this side of me. This is the first time that i ever tell anyone that I do this kind of thing.

As a kid I am so weird isn't it? Don't worry, I played games. But at the same time, I was depressed and insecure.

I'm stalking for 13 years now, holy fuck. And I'm 17. I now just realized how much of a stalker i am. Sometimes I unconsciously stalk and get absorbed by the pretty girls. Maybe that's my natural way of getting the dopamine. I don't get sexually aroused by pretty girls, I only get sexually aroused by boys who are charismatic and for their strong personality. Most of the time I don't care about how boys look like. I am into their personality more. But I easily fall for them, especially if they are introvert. I didn't even care if they were sped or my cousin, I would fall for them if I felt connected to them in some way, even without communicating to each other. It was also my main source of dopamine, having crushes.

Most of my life has been spent admiring other people, stalking them, trying to be like them, trying to make them like me, and having crushes. Getting excited for school is always from those reasons, there are times that i neglected about studying and forgot the real purpose of going to school. People was my main source of dopamine, and at the same time fearing them.

EDIT: Opening up to reddit like this was a huge mistake. I shall never open up again. Goodbye. I am just feeling more ashamed about myself, before I posted this, I was doing quite alright and I already have progress on my self therapy, but those people in the comments made me even feel worse about myself. I'm sorry.",2022-07-16 17:25:54
When I was in elementary school I convinced a classmate to use the bathroom in the playground play equipment and denied that I told him to do so,85,w0aakh,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/w0aakh/when_i_was_in_elementary_school_i_convinced_a/,5,1657953971.0,"I (6m) at the time was playing 'House' with a few classmates in one of those car type playground equipment at school. I was so in to pretend I didn't want to break away from it for even a moment. The other (6m) class mate comes up to me and says ""I have to use the bathroom. Where do I go""? I proceed to point at one of the corners and say ""There is the bathroom"". He then stated ""No, I really have to go! I am not playing"". Annoyed I again pointed at the corner and ensure him that is the bathroom and that it would be fine. Out of selfishness I didn't want him to leave me there alone while the other 2 classmates were off doing something else at the time and was just myself and him there. He goes over to the corner proceeds to pull his pants down and squats in the corner. I then turn around to do 'house chores' and not a moment later the other 2 classmates shows back up to continue playing when they notice him in the corner. They ask what he is doing before they realize and are mortified. Out of disgust One yells out ""Ewww! He is pooping!"" Out of fear of reprisal I join in their disgust. One runs over to grab a teacher and she rushes over to see what the commotion is. We are all told to get away from that area while he is just about done taking care of business. Afterwards teacher takes him aside questioning him while I am within earshot and then tells her I told him too. I see her glance over to me and already know she will be coming to question me. Already in my head I am building up a defense while she walks over to me. Before she even opens her mouth I have already convinced myself I didn't know he was being serious (like when you tell a lie so many times you believe it yourself, a defense tactic to prevent people from being able to uncover your lie). I hold my ground on my position basically chalking it up to a misunderstanding and was sucessful at least to a degree where no further action was taken. They closed off that area with caution tape and cleaned it up. Caution tape was left for at least a few weeks not wanting another incident or for sanitary reasons or both. The classmate in subject is never heard from again after the incident. Probably had moved schools or ended up getting homeschooled. I will never know. What I do know is I can't change what i did back then and I still think about it from time to time and hope he is doing well and hope he is better off now.",2022-07-16 09:46:11

My family always gave me everything I needed no matter what our financial situation was like, we were never poor but we live in a small town where we are all working class. My parents both work extremely hard and I am lucky to have them, so I feel so awful about what I did. When I was in middle school there was a kid who was a year older than me and pretty popular, I was always afraid of him and he used that. He told me to give him money and he would get me a few cigarettes. I gave him about 350$ after a I found them I my parents bedroom.
You probably think I'm stupid for paying that much for a few cigarettes, but I didn't even want them I was just scared that people would hate me more. (Its probably important to say that I was diagnosed with autism and depression a few years before that) I always struggled with saying no or upsetting people. So I gave him the money, he didn't even bring me the cigarettes but it didn't really matter to me, he said he lost the money but he probably lied. For weeks I felt so bad for disappointing my parents but I just couldn't tell them what I did, i was so afraid from their reaction, so I said nothing. Until about two months after that were my parents had to do some construction work for the kitchen and they looked for the money, they asked about it but I lied (they probably knew I was lying but didn't wanna make feel bad considering my depression affected me a lot at the time) to this day I feel awful for stealing their hard earned money, but I'll probably never have the courage to tell them everything.

He would sometimes even buy his friends boxes of snacks they wanted. And me being jealous thought of something amazingly stupid. Me, the stupid elementary kid that I was, wanted to OWN the store... And to do that, I needed a LOT of money. The next day was Friday and I was getting excited for this weekend to come since I was going to my grandmas  house. So when I got to my grandmas I waited till sunday(The day I was leaving her house) to get the money. My grandma would always hang her bag behind her seat In the car, which would give me and the bag some alone time without her noticing. That Sunday morning we went to church. And when we got out, I thought this was the time I was gonna get the money, This is my time to strike. So we get in the car and she puts her bag behind her seat as usual. And right when she starts driving I quietly unzip her bag wave my arm around till I feel something, and take out a $100 dollar bill. I zip up her bag put the bill in my pocket and we arrive home. The whole ride back I was just thinking of how I was going to be the coolest kid in the school and how I would show off to all my friends, especially that one kid. Couple hours go by and my parents come to pick me up. The next day was Monday, a school day. I get ready for school as usual and... My mom gets a call from my grandma... When She answers my grandma mentions that she is missing her rent money, $100 dollars to be exact. And my mom probably suspected me right away since I have a history of taking dollars here and there from them. So she searches me first. All my pockets and stuff then my backpack...

   I wanted to be like them, rich, and ordering delicious yet unhealthy food at the fast food chain.

   Thus, in the middle of the school year, I somehow decided to steal money from my grandma's pension. I could've stolen from my parents, but I thought that they'd notice it immediately. 

   So sadly, I took advantage of my grandma's forgetfulness. I took 1k from her wallet, which was always placed under her bed mattress. 

   When I got to school, I boasted to my classmates about it. How I've got 1k on me, and that I was going to buy them food or toys. 

   I wasted the 1k by buying notebooks I didn't need but wanted badly. I bought tons of burgers and cola because those were my dream go-to-snacks. I also bought Pokémon cards because you'd be one of the cool kids if you had those back then.

   Anyway, even after buying all the things I wanted, as well as eating lunch at the fast food chain for five days straight – it didn't make me less guilty for taking advantage of my grandma's forgetfulness and stealing money for her.

So when I was 9-12 (I don’t remember exactly) me and a lot of the neighborhood kids were playing in that green area and one of the kids, he brought out golf clubs so we could play a kind of kids version of golf. 
So when I was swinging I didn’t notice the kid behind me so I accidentally smacked him in the face with it. He started screaming and crying and all the adults started rushing over. 
Since I was a stupid kid and I was scared I ran home and said nothing hoping I wouldn’t get in trouble.

Some how nobody knew it was me who smacked him in the face and I was safe!

I worked with this other older woman who was mid 20s I believe, she lived in the inner cities area. Anyways, one day with my stupid teenage brain, I decided I deserved a little bit more money since I was very close to buying a new purse that I liked. So I decided to take some extra 20s (like 80 dollars) from the cash register when I was closing up and thought that the owner, who is a very nice guy, would not notice. Turns out he is very particular with his money and within a week, all the employees working on that day were called into the office. He was very angry that there was some money missing and that he would find out who it is and fire them. I luckily still had the money on me, and it just so happened that the woman I worked with was with me. When she went to the bathroom, I snuck the money in her purse (no cameras in the break room) and then called the owner over and said I saw her pocket the money when she was away. He then confronted the woman who cried and said she didn't know how it got there, and tried to blame it on me, but apparently she already had a misdemeanor on her record that she got for possession of drugs (marijuana I think) when she was younger and the boss already knew she was a flight risk, so she didn't listen to her anyways and fired her. Since then, I've never seen her again. I honestly haven't thought to much of it but recently I felt it weighing in on my conscience but decided to confess it here to alleviate that.",2022-07-07 02:19:18

The reason why I call him a weird kid is because he would threaten to kill people in our class and he was just really annoying. One day me and J had a good idea to say ""our friend said he likes you"" to a random girl in the hallway.  We decided to tell our other friends and then we had a group of 7 people walking with us while we were waiting for the perfect person to say it to. In the hallway leading to the cafeteria we spot this girl and we say it to her, she starts to get all red in the face and the weird kid starts getting mad at me. Fast forward to in the cafeteria I try to sit down at my seat and the weird kid is sitting next to where I sit and when I sit down he pushes me off my seat since he was mad at me. Then I walk down to where my friend J is and we make this big plan to get him even more mad. It involved getting a sticky note and writing down a pick-up line and we would give it to this girl at the end of the table with the weird kid sitting at the table. So fast forward a week and we managed to do it but the weird kid knew what it was and he started to grab me trying to get the sticky note out of my hand and he makes a big scene, teachers are coming down and a bunch of people gather around us watching. Anyways he gets it and starts crying and my and J quickly get out amd we're joking about what happened. The next day I get called down to the office and told to leave him alone and don't interact with him at all but she never called J down. So fast forward to lunch and J does the same thing again but first he starts taunting him and then he goes get a girl to walk up with him to the weird kids seat and you can tell that the weird kid was pissed. He started saying how he'll kill me and J with a box cutter and all the other shit. Anyways in our class J is still taunting the weird kid and the weird kid has enough at some point and he walks over him and puts his hand on J's shoulder saying something like ""I've had enough of this shit"" and ""I've been bullied for 7 years""  and bunch more things. Then he sits back down in his seat since J isn't reacting or anything and then the weird kid has a huge Mental break down. Someone from the office is called down and everyone in the class has to go down to the gym. I feel bad nowadays because the weird kid was pretty chill and never held a grudge on me or my friend

I dont remember who, possibly my grandpa or my brother bought me a remote controlled helicopter, in our first attempt to fly it, it crushed and some part got broken. My grandpa tried to fix it with glue but it didnt work.
My mom said that we gonna get it fixed at the store later.
My plan was to take the money and go alone to the store to buy a new one, and to throw the old one to the garbage.
I took about 150$(in todays exchange rate in that time i think the dollar were more expensive) and in the end i didnt do it. Couldn’t throw the helicopter to the garbage, I thought what if my mom would see it or someone I know and i just went to the shop and they agreed to fix it.
I really dont know why I did it… I was stealing from my parents too but they eventually found out and they punished me.
I ended up spending the money on fucking stupid stuff like pizza or candy’s.
After a few days I heard my grandpa speaking to my mom in sadness and a bit anger that the money was disappeared from his wallet, my mom told him; “thats ok whoever took it deserves to spend it on medicine”. 
My grandpa died few months/a year after that and I never forgave myself for this and I regret it all those years. I loved him so much and he was my only grandparent i had left.
A few months ago I went to his grave smoked a cigarette with him because I never had the chance at age 10, and I cried so much and told him everything.
I cant get myself to confess my mom about it and the only two who knows about that is me and his grave.",2022-07-03 19:58:32

I asked him if I could take a look at it and they refused and said how I would be able to read it anyway. That got little 6 year old me really upset. 

And so, when they were called up to the board to solve a problem, I grabbed the book and shoved it into my bag. The plan was to take a look at it and then return it. When they came back to their seat they were pissed. They started accusing me of stealing the book (I did) and wanting me to get into trouble.

The teacher came over and asked what was wrong. He told her how he had the book when he left and now it wasn't here. The kid also accused me of stealing the book using my intrest in it as the reason. The teacher turned to me and asked if this was true and I said that I didnt take the book. 

Another thing to note here is that I was the goodie two shoes of the class. I would tattle on those who broke the rules and would never ever break them myself. And so the the teacher and I said that he must of lost the book or left it at home and didn't even check my bag.

Remember this was 1999 so no Ring doorbell cams and if there was security footage it was grainy shit not stuff like today. Nobody ever caught me.

People who come home from festivals and have a hard time are weak minded people and probably shouldn't be going to them in the first place.,0,vop441,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/vop441/people_who_come_home_from_festivals_and_have_a/,36,1656640868.0,"If you are to naive to realize that nothing changed outside of the festival, then I have no sympathy and feel your perspective may be to short sighted to explore altered states of mind. It's not depression, it's a lack of serotonin and dopamine from being exposed to such extremely high amounts. Life isn't terrible and sad, you're just unable to disengage from the fantasy you built behind ""closed"" doors.

Yes, I've been to festivals.
Yes, I've explored altered states during them, outside them as well, maybe an unhealthy amount, depending who asks.
No, I never once had an issue going back to work, school.....""real life"". 

I always knew ahead that I was exposing myself to a concentrated experience withing a short amount of time and if people seriously repress the real world while they are there, I believe there are probably more important issues going on either psychologically, spirituality, perhaps physically. If that's the case, should they really be spending time, money, health and experience exposed to those extremes? 

If those certain individuals were that concerned about their health, mentally or physically, expressing love or becoming whole beings, wouldn't they take care of their anxieties, insecurities or mental illnesses before choosing to experience something so far from real life that they have a hard time coming back to real life....it just seems extremely counter productive for a large amount of people. It seems as though a fair amount idealize that experience over the rest of life and that can't be healthy, there is so much more to life than the short lived one off interactions at festivals, they are valuable, absolutely. But to dread life between them is depressing in it's self, life is greater than your last festival, bring that love into the world, the mentality can adapt to any environment, even those seemingly toxic.

Don't live in fear of life, live in love, outside or inside of the festival gates. It's all part of the same experience in the end, it's only your choice to value one over the other, I choose to value the totality of life, ups and downs.",2022-07-01 05:01:08

And the other kid was probably 3 or 4. We were at church and we had one of those bouncy blow up slides.

We were playing a game  (me and my other older friend) where one person would slide halfway or so down the slide and try to climb back up to the top where the other would try to pull them up. I don’t remember exactly where the small child’s parents were but they weren’t close. It was just us kids. 

I don’t remember how but the small child was trying to climb up to us. I wanted him to have fun with us so I did what I did with my friend and grabbed his hand and started pulling him up. Unlike my friend he didn’t help at all and I was basically pulling his weight by his arm. He started to look upset and eventually just started screaming. I dropped him and he slid to the bottom screaming. I don’t remember getting in trouble and I think me and my friend just ran in and told our parents the kid was crying out there. I don’t think even my friend knew what happened and I wasn’t even sure if I’d hurt him or he was just crying for no reason.

I remember having the realization as I was letting go of his hand that I might actually hurt this kid bc he is smaller. Then he started screaming.

I used to steal small items and lie about them when I was younger,14,vlefov,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/vlefov/i_used_to_steal_small_items_and_lie_about_them/,4,1656277533.0,"FYI: I suck at telling stories
When I was younger, think about 7 - 11 years old, I would steal stuff, small items I though were cool and then lie about where I got them from. 

I’m pretty sure this started around the time when all the boys were stealing cool tyre valve caps. anyway, my best friend at the time him and his brother had the coolest stuff and I’m not sure if it was jealousy or i just liked what they had but I stole 4 of his brothers warhammer figurines and put them on my book shelf in my room (I lived over the road from them at the time and we saw each other almost every day) any way he come over and i got really excited that I had these figurines that i just had to show how cool they were. Any way, he recognised that they were his brothers and I of course denied they were and said they came with another toy I had, his brother comes over and says that they are his so he ends up taking them and we all continue about our day like nothing had happened, I think my mum was a little more than annoyed and his mum probably hated me, end up at his place and his little sister lost $5, of course their mum accuses me (as you would with prior events) the sister ends up finding it and the mum is still not convinced I didn’t take it. 

Another occasion is that one of the boys in school had these cool pens so I devised a plan to take one by pretending to trip over and knock a few pens off the table and pick them up, of course putting one in my pocket before walking off, like prior I was so excited about having this cool pen that I showed mum, she of course asked where I got it from and I reply back “you got it for me a while back, don’t you remember” thinking that I’m so smart and that she would believe me, she didn’t. She end up crying and getting emotional with me probably thinking that her kids on a path to prison when he’s older, she says that I stole the pen and not lie so I agree that I did take the pen and agree to give it back, of course I did the same thing I did before, tripping over and knocking the pens off and putting my pen that was his back.

There’s another occasion when we were on holiday but it’s very minor and not worth typing out

Apart from when I was younger I haven’t stolen anything in the past 16+ years but I still feel like I’m am absolutely shit person for betraying my friend and to this day I hold my self to very high standards, maybe I’m subconsciously trying to make up for what I did when I was younger.

I stole books from a charity and then threw them away,430,vl9uu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/vl9uu7/i_stole_books_from_a_charity_and_then_threw_them/,39,1656264660.0,"This post is inspired from the post a guy made about needlessly stealing books from Barnes and Noble. What I did wasn't the same but similar. 

A couple years ago I was in a Christian men's adult rehab. It worked like Job Corps. We all lived in an apartment building. We worked 45 hours a week at the nearby thrift store ran by the charity. This is the same charity that has people ringing bells around christmastime for donations. 

It was a strictly ran place. We had to shave every morning, had to have a collared shirt tucked in when not in our room, had to attend church twice a week and participate as well as look happy. The people that ran the place believed that we could all better ourselves if Jesus was involved with every part of our life. That also meant the media we consumed. The television we watched had to be PG or Christian related. And the same went for books. They had a ""library"" which was one measly bookshelf and it only contained God themed self help books. 

This was no good for me as I was 1. An Atheist and 2. An avid reader. I've been in drug treatment multiple times and what got me through those *excruciatingly boring* times were books. A good rehab has lots of books. I've probably read 50+ books altogether from my time in rehab. So, this simply would not do. I'd have to either watch shit TV with everyone else (I'm an introvert so that isn't fun) or lay in bed and day dream (not great when all you can think about is how you got there.) 

So, like I said, we worked at their nearby thrift store. That organization takes donations, sorts through them, and sells what's sellable in the store. Books are not popular. They don't sell. Even if you put out a box of books for $5 there's no sale. But people would donate books all the time. Every day. You can imagine, the amount of books we had would sometimes get out of hand. What we did is we sorted the donations and put books into gaylords, which are large pallet boxes. One gaylord (yes that's what they're called) could hold a couple thousand books. 

They did the same thing with shoes, DVDs, and cheap handbags. Once the boxes were full, some company would come by and buy them up. No clue what they did with giant boxes of DVDs and shoes. The giant boxes of books went to some paper recycling people. The books were going to be destroyed. 

This pained me. I would look busy by rummaging through the books. I would see so many classics, pop novels like Stephen King and Michael Crichton. They were so close but I was not allowed to have those books. On one hand if I brought a book back from the store it would count as stealing and I would be kicked out on the spot; instantly homeless with nowhere to go. On the other hand they were non-religious texts which were also banned. But I had to have them and enjoy them, so I came up with a plan. 

I began to pick out books I wanted to read and hid them in the back area. I hid them good, because stuff would get moved around often and I didn't want to lose a book I really wanted to read. It did happen a few times that I lost a book I wanted to read. I would just keep an eye on the book piles and inevitably another copy would show up which was exhilarating, like finding gold. 

Once I had a collection of books, I had to figure out how to get them back to the residence without being caught. Stealing was on the mind of the bosses all the time. People would get kicked out for stealing jewelry, money they find in clothes, nice shoes, nice clothes, etc. Sometimes they would line us up and pat down people they suspected of stealing from the store, so avoiding that was my biggest hurdle. I wanted to bring a *book* back. How can you hide a book on yourself? I had the Game of Thrones novels stashed. They were thick. They would notice if I had one in my pants! It would be obvious! What was I to do? And then I had a great idea. 

Once I had a good hiding spot where I knew my books wouldn't be found and tossed at the store, I began the confiscation. What I did was would rip out 100 or so pages at a time and stuff that section down my pants. Paperback books actually rip very easily, you basically just pry the section off from the spine. It comes off with glue still attached and it's like a little tiny book. Pages still held together. When I stuffed those sections down my pants you couldn't tell. I also did this because I was a model member of the program and had everyone's trust. They never suspected me of stealing. I was able to read these sections at night and then I'd throw away the pages the next day so they'd never be found because our rooms were searched during the day. On Fridays before the weekend I'd sneak a couple hundred pages on me because there was a lot of down time on the weekend. I was able to read 25-30 books this way over a 6 month period. 

Towards the end of my time there I began advocating for regular books to be brought into the residence. I had established seniority and trust so they listened to me. I would gather up a bunch of books that people requested and then I'd have to submit them to the higher ups for approval. During that time I was still stealing books though because they wouldn't approve of lots of the books. 

I never got caught. And that's how I stole books from a charity and then threw them away. 

TL:DR; I was in a rehab that banned books so I snuck them in my pants and read them then threw them away to hide the evidence",2022-06-26 20:31:00

one more thing. i used to pray every time i steal, saying that I'll return the money someday. that's fucked up. im like the robin hood or some thing. my mom threw all the gifts i bought to trash to bury my sin. and my grandfather eventually died five years later. i still haven't returned the money.

Just my brother being mad at a video game or I just lose my temper or just out of the blue I get mad at my brother and do something to him. Most of the times I would hit, slap, or choke him but there were sometimes when I would push him into a dresser causing him to hurt his head or I would push him into the wall then slap the living hell out of him for no reason. Or choke the living crap out of him then let go after a few seconds. One time I threw him off of his own bed (we had a bunk bed and he had the top of it). Everytime I did any of this I tried to make him better not to tell my mom but when he did I tried to make it seem like wether he was lying or I just didn't do anything he said. I still remember the looks on his faces he made whenever I abused him (Those faces remind me how horrible I was as a older brother because he really cared for me and I was just breaking his heart). He would just cry and run to our mom to tell her what happened and most of the time I would get off Scott free. One time I even tried to bite his fingers off and tried to bite a chunk of his arm off but of course I didn't. Each time I abused him I still cared for him and felt bad but just kept doing it for a unknown cause. And during all of this he loved me as the older brother I was and I was just being the worst brother imaginable. Currently me and him have a pretty stable relationship. We hang out together and we get along very well. I make sure to tell him I love you everytime we go to bed. I make sure to not abuse or harm him in any way physically or mentally and be honest whenever I tell my parents what happened whenever we get into conflict. I regret every single bit I did those 3 years of abuse I did to my brother. It makes me very sick and often makes me want to harm myself in very bad ways.

I work at a small sainsburies and in the staff room there were 3 boxes of small mini pack coke. I didn’t know if they were free so I just took one as I assumed they were as that’s usually the case with stuff in staff room when I finished my shift. There are no cams on staff or stockroom so things go missing all the time but I came in the next day and my supervisor asked if I stolen one which I said no to as they can tell it went missing during a certain point. I said no as I was afraid I be sacked even if It was by mistake and my co worker got sacked for stealing a lot of money from the tills. So while on my break I bought a pack then when I finished my shift I put the box I bought and put it on the back stock to which I messaged my supervisor saying I think I found the box when I came in the get the charger I forgot in the back stock cages as it’s next to the staff room. I wondering will I be sacked over this or am I thinking to much. 
To add I’ll obviously be asked again but I’ll just say no I didn’t take it as I don’t want to be sacked for dishonesty",2022-06-12 17:54:52

The first place prize was a cool action figure that my brother really wanted to win, and the second place prize was a bunch of candy. Me being young and having a sweet tooth, I was craving the candy instead of the action figure( which my brother pointed out was stupid). Anyways there was a tie that went down between my team and another team, so I got picked individually out of a hat to compete for the first place prize with some other kid from another team. Evidently I lost and ended up not winning the action figure for my brother, and he looked super sad and disappointed in me for losing. I decided that I wanted to cheer him up, so I broke into the kids locker, snatched his action figure that he won and stuffed it into my bag. When I got home I tried to surprise my brother, I gave it to him thinking that he would be happy, but boy was I wrong… instead he questioned the hell out of me, because I lied to him saying that the kid gave it to me cuz he didn’t want it. Obviously he didn’t believe me considering he saw how happy the kid was to win the toy. My brother ended up ratting to my mom about it, told her that I stole the action figure from kid. To which I argued that I just wanted my brother to be happy, since I knew he wanted the toy. My mom made me bring the kid back his toy, and apologize to him.

I think it was my sophomore or junior year, we had a big paper to write over a book we were supposed to read, House on Haunted Hill possibly, which would be fitting. I didn’t read the damn book (then) and totally copied my friends paper. I changed it enough but was sure he’d see through my shit. 

I got an A! And every damn time I saw this teacher he would tell me how brilliant my paper was. Did he know??? Did he torture me with this for the next decade??

I remember the first time I did it. I put it in his eyes and ears. I remember waking up to him panicking and calling to our parents for help. After seeing how he reacted I was scared and I decided not to do it again. That was until he broke one of my toys. I don’t know what the toy was but it made me mad. When he fell asleep that night I took out the glue and I poured it in his nose. I used the rest of the bottle and got it all over. He woke up because his airway was obstructed and he started to freak out. I threw the bottle at him and our parents ran in the room. I was in deep trouble.

I robbed and vandalized a house in my neighborhood and can't seem to get over it.,182,ut48p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ut48p2/i_robbed_and_vandalized_a_house_in_my/,46,1652969315.0,"Last year (2021) i was in a very bad mental state because my at the time girlfriend had left me due to school, my grades where visibly deteriorating and I always heard my parents talking about lack of money and etc... My dad always told me that i need ot take advantage of my education because it costs money and i always felt as if there was no money because of me. 

  
My at the time friend ''a '' convinced me and my friend ''e'' to enter a a house that had been for rent for around 7 years. originally we where just going to go inside to see how another house of the neighborhood looked, but then later he suggested that we brought spray paint to vandalize. We entered the house like 5 times in one week and each time it got worse. the first time we just entered. the second time we stole the little things we found (soap, toothbrush, pen) the third time when we entered ''a'' and ''e'' started to spray everything, and while i didn't participate i was still inside encouraging misbehavior. the fourth time we entered, ''e'' decided to bring a hammer and ''a'' brought a knife. ''e'' broke a mirror and ''a'' cut the mosquito mesh(es) and the water tubes.

A few days after this the neighbors noticed that there was water leaving at an alarming pace from the house and decided to investigate. As you might imagine they saw all the disaster we did. Eventually ''e'' confessed to his mom what he had done as well as what we had done. HOWEVER ''a'' cleaned his hands and blamed everything on me and ''e'', EVEN THOUGH HE DID ALMOST EVERYTHING. my dad, e and me started to clean the house (because we made a deal that if we cleaned and fixed the mess we made the owner of the house wouldnt proceed legally). ''a'' never showed up. 

In december we have something called ''posadas'' which basically are some sort of reunion where you go to someones garage pray and chant and then get free food. ''a'' seemed all giddy, happy and free, while me and ''e'' went once or twice (the posadas happen every day of the week exept weekend). I just couldnt comprehend how he didn't feel as horrible as i did.

Im not sure when but at some point he came to my street and knocked on my friends' doors (of course none of them asnwered to a rat) and then left smiling and waving at me in a passive aggressive way. At the time i wasnt allowed to leave my house so i went to instagram and in my story said that if i saw him again me and ''e'' would jump him.

A few weeks after i started to go outside again. however, i noticed that ''a'' suddenly was walking around with all the kids of the neighborhood plus some of his family. This obviously being a pussy move,  i addressed it in my instagram story too. one day i saw him walking around with a machete. Me and ''e'' where going to our neighbourhood's football field, and his mom came to me and told me that i need to stop ''threatening her son''. to this me and ''e'' laughed because this was obviously a lie. Later the same day ''a'' came to my street with his flock and told me ''don't disrespect my mom hijoeputa''. 

So far my menacing was more of a scare, but now i was willing to engage in verbal and physical assault, however before i could my dad and his mom brought us together to ''apologise'' to each other. since then there have been no more threats but we are far from friends.

all of this happened between november 2021 and february 2022. on valentines day i got a girlfriend, my grades have been going up and i visited my school friends for the first time in 2 years, but i still get haunted by that incident and i can't seem to forget it. especially now that our house and the neighbors have been subject to attempted robbery 4 times, i can't help but think that i used to be a criminal just like the ones trying to enter our house.... maybe it is karma or maybe it is some sort of unresolved tension, but i can't seem to forget that story and it haunts me and i hate it. if someone can tell me something i can do to help myself please do.

While in the US, I took the chance to buy and try out all of the flavors, but wasn't able to bring any back home because the bottles are over 100ml, and airports don't allow you to take anything over the limit with you. So, I decided to bring the empty bottles of Prime I drank from while in the US with me back to Canada as a souvenir, as it was the next best thing. When we got back from vacation, I sent pictures of the bottles to a group chat with kids in my school in it. I didn't think much of it until one kid, Let's call him Alex, messaged me asking how much he could buy them from. I thought about telling him the truth, but wanted to see how much he was actually willing to buy them for. He told me he could give me 40 dollars if I could give him one of the orange and one of the lemon lime flavored ones. This was an amazing deal since I bought them for about 3 dollars each. So I told him it was a deal. Not knowing what to do, I decided to fill the empty bottles with Gatorade and try to pass it off as Prime. Well, it worked. He bought them without realizing and that was that. And, to add insult to injury I found out after I sold them to him that he planned to give them to his brother from his Birthday.

I found proper RRL, Validations, Methodology and I specifically told my panelists and advisor how I will collect data and they never budged. I collected data by watching videos. Then on march 2021, I had a progress report where I was roasted and I was told my validation was not valid for the method I was using so I had to change. 

THIS ISwhere the problems staryed cuz my advisor took days to reply to me and It was so hard doing a solo thesis online. Thankfully I found a validation and on  the may 2021 defense whicg is supposed to be the final defense.........I was roasted again and this time.....someone said my data collection is not valid. I was told I had to compare my cpllection with an expert of the field to validate my data. I WAS PISSED because I was never told about it even in defense. I was given a problem that should have been told at the beginning. I had one and a half month left tl send my data to two experts and compare my data. I found two experts but their data was way way off to mine. I asked if I can keep the experts' name anonymous and my advisor said yes.

she had me blocked on every social media, because she didn't want me to know she was copying all my videos and posts. one day i was with my friend and i found out she traced one of my drawings. i was actually a pretty good artist, and drawing was my main hobby, so this was the thing that pissed me off the most. the copycat (we'll call her kat), had sent pictures of her traced drawings to my friend saying ""i put so much effort into this, do you like it?"" i was enraged. that was one of my favorite drawings, and i was proud of it, and kat just traced it stroke-for-stroke and claimed it was her own. she never traced my drawings before, as far as i knew. she just tried her best to copy it without tracing.

the next time i went to school, i stood in the back of the line to go to lunch. when the teacher was out of sight, i ran back into the classroom, got in kat's desk, and went through her sketchbooks. i saw so many copied drawings that weren't yet finished, so i ripped all of those pages out, ripped them up, and tossed them in the recycle. the next day, we were talking and she says ""i noticed all my drawings are gone, i must've lost them or something."" i just said ""oh that's weird, hope you find them.""

They told me to get inside, to which I was fairly concerned as I wasn't the type to engage in stealing any cars or anything like that... Turns out we were just doing a fairly common activity we all often do: smoking a few joints (weed), and enjoying our night.

I bullied my sister severely for years when we were younger,761,umy1uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/umy1uh/i_bullied_my_sister_severely_for_years_when_we/,62,1652232146.0,"I remember growing up I had a lot of trust issues, felt lonely constantly, was extremely negative, and had low empathy for others. The only friend I had at the time, looking back on it, wasn't the best friend (she didn't let me be friends with anyone else, and was kinda a bad influence ngl). 

What I did was play pretend/make believe with my sister, for hours and hours. It was the only thing that bought me joy. I believe it was a coping mechanism (escapism) to escape life/my feelings and to feel like life wasn't boring.  I deliberately created problems and always made her the scapegoat. I called her things like heartless and made extreme situations that I don't think either of us were able to handle. 

I don't know whether this next part was a result of me not getting the physical affection I needed from my parents or if I was just weird, but I... had an obsession with tickling when I was younger. I would watch tickling videos on YouTube for hours, and it likewise was the only thing bringing me joy (I guess seeing people laughing/looking happy made me feel better). My sister later told me (after I had stopped this behavior) that us watching tickling videos on Youtube made her uncomfortable, and that she went to my parents to talk about it. My parents just dismissed her and told her to tell me to just play on my own. This made me feel guilty because nobody listened to her. 

I never really thought about my actions when I was younger, which, I guess, kids are like that, but I didn't realize that what I was doing was hurting her. Like I genuinely thought my feelings were fact and that what I was doing was me trying to help her.. which it obviously wasn't looking back on it. I remember I got joy out of making her the scapegoat + making up fake situations, so that it felt like life wasn't so ""boring""... and as a kid I just really wanted to be in the middle of the drama, so I would make up situations like that (because, as I said before, life was ""boring"" and I wanted something interesting to happen.. even if that was at the expense of my sister, which I didn't realize it was).

I later apologized for my behavior, but I still feel extremely bad that I did this to her. While I know we were just kids, I had extremely low empathy with others and still occasionally struggle with it sometimes. She has said that she moved on, but I still struggle with my feelings and what I did.

This behavior (playing make believe/pretend and hurting her) stopped when I was about 11 or 12. What happened was I had just gotten back from a cruise and decided that I didn't need to play make believe/pretend with my sister for hours to ""feel"" happy (and the truth was, I was never really happy)-- there were things in life that could make me happy.

Also, I don't know whether this was the result of purely my actions, or a combination of my actions, the crappy teacher she was dealing with at the time, and my dad being emotionally hurtful all the time, but she expressed to me later that after I stopped the behavior she felt suic!dal. I asked her if it was my fault and she said that oftentimes when I had come to bully/torment her after I was done she would kinda just shrug it off and move on. I don't know if I've been retreating into my feelings too much, but she did cry a few times after I bullied her, so my impression is that I did hurt her a lot-- but she says she's moved on. Either way, I still feel really bad for what happened.",2022-05-11 04:22:26

I work as a DSP and saw a coworker abuse a client for months and let it happen,184,um9sjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/um9sjv/i_work_as_a_dsp_and_saw_a_coworker_abuse_a_client/,65,1652155349.0,"I am a 19M and I have been a DSP ( direct support provider ) for 2 and a half years. When I was 17 I wasn't allowed to get my license and work with clients alone because of laws in my state, so I went through a certain work program to essentially get paid hourly for shadowing a worker. I got stuck with a 34F I'll call Taylor who worked in home. The client was a 25M I'll call Sam. Sam was fully cognitive and had no sort of mental challenges or handicaps. Sam had DMD ( Duchene Muscular Dystrophy ) and had no outside support from family or friends aside from his mother who worked too much to take care of him and the company providing assistance , the assistance being myself and Taylor. Within my first month of working after being shown the ropes of how to assist Sam with eating, dressing himself, using the bathroom, etc. I noticed the way Taylor talked about Sam was very rude and full of malice almost. Always talking bad and complaining about how much the job entailed whenever she had the chance. Whenever she would talk about Sam on the phone to family or friends she would describe him as a object instead of a person. And one day ( to keep it short ) I came in roughly 30 minutes late and saw Taylor cursing Sam out for being such a nuisance and a "" weight on her shoulders to constantly deal with "". She screamed at him saying horrible things about him as a person and his future for easily 15 minutes. She kept telling him he would never amount to anything and that all he will ever be is a sad empty shell that sits in his house and sucks up all of his mom's money. I tried to play it off as if I just got there and loudly opened and closed the front door so she would stop screaming at him and she did. I gave her the usual good morning and she told me to "" have fun cleaning him "" and left to go to smoke outside on the porch. I went in sam's room and he was crying so hard that his face was best red, eyes puffy, and he was just calming down from a panic attack. I did the usual for the rest of the day and didn't say a thing about hearing anything and sadly didn't report it to my boss or the company, or Sam's mom. To my knowledge it was a one time thing, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if she did it whenever she needed a load off of her chest. I am a licensed DSP now and will/would never treat my clients let alone a human being that way, and it eats away at me everyday thinking about how I did and said nothing until I was 18 and got moved clients. I know I'm a piece of shit for doing nothing and I will never be able to make it up but I had to say it so yeah.

EDIT : I'll try to answer all the questions and keep them as short as possible because I am currently leaving for work in 20 minutes. As I know now Sam is doing better and becoming more active in his community, and his DSP is a really cool dude and trys to take him to meet new people all the time. ( I met his DSP at a local party for clients in homes ) Taylor is no longer employed I believe. A quick search on Facebook revealed she assumingly drinks A LOT, and one of her kids passed away during the time it was going on. So they could explain her behavior but under no circumstances validates it. There is mainly 2 reasons I can't report her anymore. One severe pack of evidence that would spark an investigation that would go nowhere and only cause problems for his current DSP. And because I am 99% sure she does not work here.
Thank you all for the nice words, and feel free to keep asking any questions you may have about the situation or the field in general!",2022-05-10 07:02:29
I just cost my friend a couple hundred dollars in locksmith fees and convinced her it's her fault,1479,ulp3qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ulp3qn/i_just_cost_my_friend_a_couple_hundred_dollars_in/,87,1652095815.0,"My friend and I just graduated college this weekend. We decided to go out drinking, but I had a flight this morning to catch so I told her I won't be staying out past 11. I left my bookbag with my car keys in her apartment because she agreed to that time but I couldn't leave without her.

She got way, way too drunk and was practically begging a boy to come home with her. I'm begging her to leave around midnight. I finally convinced her to go home around 12:30. She's fucking inebriated. 

We get there, she's telling me how worried she is for me flying, and tries to give me a million things to take with me. I ""accept"" all the things and then put them back in her room. This goes on for about an hour. She then says she can't possibly go to sleep alone tonight so she needs go ""to teach that boy a lesson"" and is looking for her keys to go to his house. I obviously couldn't let her drive so I hid her keys in her closet. I finally convince her to lay down, and I leave. I locked her bedroom door behind me hoping it would confuse her enough so she couldn't leave until morning.

A minute ago I get a call saying she woke up on the living room couch and now she's locked out of her room. She was looking for her keys so she could get an uber and left her room to check the living room and when she came back the door was locked behind her. 

I think the door didn't lock all the way when I left. I didn't check the handle. And she got out but couldn't get back in. Now her keys are hidden in her closet and she can't leave her apartment because she won't be able to get back in. 

Her roommate is insane and has actually sent her death threats so she doesn't like to be in the apartment at the same time as her. She now can't leave for hours and her roommate might actually kill her.

This is my fault. I hid her keys and I locked the door. I told her I hid her keys but didn't tell her about the door and just told her she was so drunk she probably locked it behind her. I'm such an awful friend but I had to leave to get my flight at 8 am and I didn't leave her apartment until after 2. I also live 30 minutes away. I woke up 30 minutes before I have to leave and I haven't packed or anything.

I'm upset she kept me up, but my consequences are being tired and rushing. Hers are a couple hundred on a locksmith. I'm a bad friend

I broke my mum's new(ish) TV out of anger and I regret it,734,ul4f2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ul4f2m/i_broke_my_mums_newish_tv_out_of_anger_and_i/,81,1652024522.0,"So a bit of backstory: 

My mum sometimes gets very mad at me out of the blue for seemingly no reason (eg, saying I'm an embarrassment to the family, that I fake being nice to people, I don't deserve friends and I deserve every ounce of hate I receive, to name a few), and these tend to happen when she just isn't in a good mood (I do nothing to provoke her). 

Compared to everyone else my age, I'm extremely well behaved, polite, get good grades (Tippically B-A+), don't do drugs, drink, smoke or any of that shit and I always make sure to put others above myself (mostly because of my shitty self esteem), so I'm not sure why she does it.


The main point (FYI, it all happened today):

Well today she was doing it again, and as a reaction (when she left the room) I hit her TV (about 7-8 months old) with the corner of my phone. I didn't see any damage (as it was turned off) so I assumed It didn't do any harm.

Later, she went to turn it on and half of the screen was black and covered with cracks and coloured lines. She seemed devastated and quite bummed out about it (obviously) but didn't go to blame me. Obviously I knew it was me that did it, but I didn't have the heart to tell her.

And to put salt in the wound, shortly after arguing with me for a while, she apologised to me and admitted she was in the wrong (for the first time ever).


Was I in the wrong, or did she have it coming?
Any tips on what I could do to apologise would also be appreciated.

TLDR: My mum goes ape shit at me, so I somewhat accidentally break her TV

I worked on the highway - our debit machines weren’t connected to the cash registers per say; so you have to punch in the order in the register & then punch it into the debit machine, then place that debit receipt in the register & mark the order as ‘debit’

In other words, if you don’t punch it in the register the order never existed.  Creating gift cards was done on the debit machine, similar to a refund, you’d select a gift card option & type the amount to go on, swipe the card & it’s good to use! But if it’s never typed in the register, no one knows the debit machine put money on a gift card so I’d occasionally give myself a ‘free’ $10 gift card here & there

I was able to stick my hand in & I pulled out several bills.  My guess is that when it was loaded with cash, the cash would pile up & stick up; when the drawer opens, the bills get caught in the top & fall behind the drawer, once the drawer closes, it pushes said bill back behind the drawer. 

Every shift I would reach in & grab any bills from the previous shifts. 

Working on the highway, the exit basically lead you right back onto the highway again so I was fast with the customers, I’d have their coffee & donut ready for them when they got to the window.  They’d give me a $10, I’d give them their coffee & donut & I swear 3/5 times, they’d drive off without remembering to get their change.

We looked at that car, it was a luxury lancia , I didn't remember the model but it was from the 80's and I tried to open the door just for discovering that was open and keys was still in!

I destroyed a text book and stole money from my parents to hide it.,54,uftudj,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/uftudj/i_destroyed_a_text_book_and_stole_money_from_my/,10,1651386826.0,"When I (m) was in 4th grade I put a sticker on the front of my math textbook.  It was the first year i had take home text books. Every year before that we used a classroom set.  I didn't know I had to give it back. 

At the end of the year,  the teacher told us to turn them in . They told me that they couldn't accept it because it had the sticker on the front. This was after they explained that if you couldn't turn your book in it was $150 to the school to replace it. 

I went to my desk to panic, not knowing how to remove the sticker. At first I tried peeling it, but it was too stuck. I then proceeded to use a pair of metal safety scissors to gouge the front of the book until you could distinguish the sticker anymore. Just a carved up a 4in by 4in squar on the front cover.

I turned the book in again, and explained what I had done to the teacher. I figured I had made it right. I was wrong. 

My parents had to pay for a new book but I didn't want to get in trouble.  I knew where my mom kept signed blank checks (for my dad's checking  account, incase he was gone and there was an emergency.) I filled in the number and turned it into the front office. I said my dad didn't know who to fill it out to,  so the secretary just stamped the name of the elementary school on it. 

This was the mid 2000's and so there were more instant alerts when the money was pulled from the account.  My parents wouldn't find the money missing until the did taxes at the end of the year.  I never heard them fight so I figured they just chalked it up to a miscalculation or an unrecorded school expense.",2022-05-01 09:33:46

So my little brother and I had a history of stealing since our family wasn't very well off and both of us were really young, at some point it became thrilling (at least for me) as long as not caught that is. 

Everynight we went on late night walks with dad, there was a supermarket 5 minutes away so we would often go there for snacks or just for fun. 
There were chocolates that I really wanted, dad did buy one for me but I wanted more, I was greedy but I didnt wanna spend money so I occasionally stole them. 
Back then I didn't like buying but enjoyed looking around more (denying that I'm just cheap).

One day I couldn't find some coins that I put in my jacket pockets, I discovered that the coins were in the inner layer of the jacket. After some investigating I found out that the pocket had a hole in it in which I could reach the inner layer, I had a very bad Idea. 

It started with chocolates and candies to expensive drinks. 

I don't really remember how dad found out but I'm pretty sure I teamed up with him & my little brother since we are close.
At some point our fridge became full, I asked dad if we could sell it off at some other store and to even discount it bc there's no loss for us since it's stolen anyways.
We didn't realize how much we really stole until we counted the money, it was so weird.

 
I don't shoplift (as often) anymore, it has become scary as I grew since I could face harsher consequences now. 
I don't feel guilty about it at all, am I a bad person?

My first initial thought was why was no smoke going in my mouth. So then I released that the cigar was the wrong one way so i cut off the part that Was burning and flipped it. So now I was finally smoking it the right way & then suddenly I start coughing like crazy. So I put it out of my mouth. After that I was regretting my decisions. SO what did 14 teen year old me do? I decide that I’m going to smoke a cigarette and basically the same thing happens. And even because I hear footsteps and my heat starts pounding like crazy it ended up being my sister so no worries.

"When I was a teen, I lied about my mental health for attention.",60,ueglwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ueglwe/when_i_was_a_teen_i_lied_about_my_mental_health/,45,1651217588.0,"A little over a decade ago, I was a freshman in high school and almost every friend I had was dealing with some sort of mental illness. The only kids that were ever nice to me in school were the kids with learning disabilities. We were a loyal group of friends and we always stood up for each other because we all got bullied a lot. For some reason, medication and therapy was often a hot topic for us at lunch. They were always talking about therapists and different doctors they had. Hearing about my friends being able to just sit down and talk about their feelings with an adult made me feel jealous. And for some reason, my teenage brain thought the best way to get the attention I wanted, was to start telling very drastic lies. 

I would start conversations with my friends at lunch about offing myself, hoping a teacher would hear the discussion and report me. At my church youth group, I was making up sob stories to the adult leaders. I remember googling the symptoms of depression and writing letters to the leaders with some of the symptoms sprinkled in, hoping they’d figure it out and be concerned about me. One day the school counselor showed my class a PSA about depression and self injury and after class that day I made an appointment with the counselor and told her I was having s*icidal thoughts. Of course, she had to call my parents and my mom came to pick me up from school that day. Within a week, I had my first appointment with my own therapist, who I continued lying to because I wanted her to care about me. A few times, before my appointment, I would Google the symptoms of other mental illnesses to try convincing my therapist that I really was mentally ill. I really tried getting her to believe I had OCD, but I think she saw right through me. I never stopped lying about being depressed. Sometimes she would call my school and advise the counselor and other administration about me. Something about knowing how many people cared about how I felt really did it for me. I remember sitting the therapists office trying to think of the most concerning things I could say to her because I knew she was going to be calling and emailing other people about me. 

During that whole time, my mother barely spoke to me. Usually when she’s mad, she doesn’t speak to or acknowledge me for a few days, but this time she didn’t speak to me for at least a whole month. I remember trying to have a conversation with her several times and she’d just give me a blank stare like she really didn’t care about what I said. She barely even made eye contact with me. I eventually stopped trying to talk to her and the house was so quiet my dad said that I single-handedly train wrecked our household. When my mom did start talking to me, she said I wasn’t being fair to her or my dad, because dad was trying to sell his firearms and he shouldn’t have had to do that. 

Eventually, I couldn’t keep up with my lies and I was afraid I had permanently ruined my family. One night, after screaming and cussing me out for hours, my mom demanded to know why I was depressed. She kept yelling that my depression was not her fault and that she and my father had done nothing wrong. At that point the only secret I was keeping from my parents was that I’m gay. When mom was done screaming, I said that I was depressed because I’m gay. In reality, I had no difficulty coming to terms with that fact. At the time, I was just tired of being yelled at. 

A few months after that, my family moved and I never saw a therapist or any mental health professional again. I felt so terrible about the lies I told and the stress I put my parents through. After we moved, I still wanted attention, but I didn’t wanna lie anymore, I asked my parents if they could take me to a new therapist, but they never did and I never asked again. To this day, I’ve never told them it was all a lie.  I feel so bad about what I did. I am ashamed that I lied about such a terrible, heartbreaking topic. I am so deeply sorry for what I did.",2022-04-29 10:33:08
Deliberately organised a bad work xmas party so I didn't have to go,10,ueaygm,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/ueaygm/deliberately_organised_a_bad_work_xmas_party_so_i/,10,1651197027.0,"This happened a while ago (obviously) and was pre-covid.

I was the office manager and I was told to organise the work xmas party for about 30 people.

Everyone would need to pay for themselves AND it was outside of work time. Both a big no from me but surprisingly, there were some people kinda interested in an after work dinner/drinks outing.

Our xmas parties were voluntary and normally I didn't go to them because I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere but if I was the organiser I kinda had to go. I had been there a few years, no issue with the people, but I kept work/social separate.

So, I was a bit of a foodie, nothing big but started hamming it up a bit more at work. Mention the fancy restaurant degustations I'd go to or some of the different cuisine I was trying on weekends. 

So I chose a cuisine that wasn't weird but unfamiliar enough so people were out of their comfort zones (portuguese).

Because it was xmas, restaurants were only doing set menus. So I found one that was a bit pricier but not crazy expensive to look like I did it on purpose ($70 per person without drinks - we're in a no-tipping country)

Different food + expensive menu = 3 RSVP yes and a cancelled xmas party.

It was entirely deliberate, sorry but not sorry.",2022-04-29 04:50:27

I usually fast for the whole day before going out, I know thats the opposite of what people say you should do but if I eat I will always end up vomiting. My friend was throwing a last minute ""blackout"" party where the only lights were glow sticks. Unfortunately because it was last minute I had already eaten that day, even worse, it was spinach dip. 

I go to the party anyway and drink my face off, because we're in Uni and thats just what you do. I could feel I was going to vomit so I ran to the bathroom and opened the door to find a couple having sex on the counter and they slammed the door on me. At this point there was no going back. I projectile vomited bright green spinach dip all across their wall. A girl helped me to the sink and got me water but I made a very swift exit after that and went home to pass out. Luckily I lived near by.

I relentlessly bullied my sister for years after she was born,52,udzowz,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/udzowz/i_relentlessly_bullied_my_sister_for_years_after/,157,1651165131.0,"My mom and dad were the definition of ""in love"" and everything was perfect until she passed away while I was still a child. Both me and dad were beyond heartbroken. One of our main supports was my aunt who became a spiritual mother to me. For a while, dad didn't want to date again and focused all of his energy in taking care of me. As if to make up for my mom's loss. 

He eventually started dating a woman (my current stepmom) and even married her. She is alright. Was meaner, became softer, we get along understandably good. Her and dad were quite in love from what I can tell. When I was ten, she gave birth to a baby girl, my half sister. I was excited at first, because most of my friends had brothers. She was a regular baby, but my dad and my stepmom adored her. The first months I considered it natural parent behavior when they have a newborn, but then, seeing her mom showering her with a kind of love that I didn't know this woman could feel and essentially seeing my dad shifting his main priority from me to her, made me starting to resent her. What is worse: the only person that asked me if I ever felt left out was my aunt. I vaguely told her about my feelings and she talked to my dad, but I still couldn't get over my jealousy and envy for the baby.

I started to do small things that would put her in discomfort, such as hiding her toys, knocking over her food or play sets ""by mistake"", breaking her favorite dolls, etc. My parents caught on it, but blamed the context and figured I'd stop as we'd grow up. I didn't. And the best part? As I was getting older, I became to have much more responsabilities towards her. I even offered to do things for her so I'd get the opportunity to make her hurt. More than one time, I was to pick her up from school and I ""conveniently forgot"" or happen to ""run incredibly late"", ""miss several busses"" and so on. Inclined to do so the worse the weather was. I did everything I could to see her sad and at some point could even say her suffer was bringing me joy.

I loved picking fights with her and I was quite the master talker, managing to guilt shame her almost all the time. I was always belittling her especially in public, never hesitating to point out all her flaws. My parents were both asian, but her mom is white, so she is interracial, a thing that I never ceased to exploit, telling her she's not part of our culture, but neither white. Also adding that since she's mixed, she can't look good in either of the stereotypical styles. It was pure happiness for me to see her breaking. She loved me and saw a role model in me, and I was taking every chance I had to take her down. Why? Because I felt like she stole important parts of my life from me. 

At some point, I started to lose interest and was mainly doing it because of habit. I eventually gave up completely as I started to focus on my goals and projects. Only later I realized how wrong was I to put her through all that, but I never tried to make up to her mainly because she didn't ever blame me and I have no idea how, now that we're more or less with our own lives. I keep in touch with her, but we're not really close. We never were. I regret, but not really much. More like when you have two ice cream flavors to pick and after you ate one you wished you picked the other. I'm trying to let it pass and hopefully, neither mine nor her children will experience anything similar.",2022-04-28 19:58:51

Anyways when I was younger in year 4 in school (UK so was about 8 or 9) there was a wee guy in school who I didn't really get on with, but he didn't really have alot of friends and our mum's were friends so kinda got forced into speaking to him

ANYWAYS he heard I just got the new Spyro game: Spyro: Year of the dragon, for my birthday a few days prior and asked to take a lend of it, now I'd not even had time to play it and said no and he threw a wee fit in front of our mum's when walking home from school, my mum was like ""oh just let him, you can always play it another time""

**after speaking to my mum in the future about it  she says she  was just tryna appease the boy and wasn't aware until it was too late he was asking for the game I begged her for months for and not the older one I'd played to death**

So anyways he goes ""you lend me this Ill lend you Pokémon Gold"" so yeah okay sure at this point I'm done with the conversation and  just want home for my dinner 

The next day in school I bring my game to him I'd taken it out the cellophane the previous night just so I could get a shot of it before anyone else got to, and he brings me Pokémon gold 

Him: "" right here you go, don't start a new game because I worked hard on my save and don't want to start again ..oh and I haven't completed it yet so please don't save over my save if you do get new badges or anything, I'll bring spyro back on Monday""

So now not only does he have my brand new game, I'm basically sitting holding onto his Pokémon game unable to play it 

Two weeks rolls by and he kept saying he 'needed more time' and threw fits whenever I complained  eventually on the Friday 2 and a half weeks since he lent it he brings it in, the box is cracked and the disc had a huge cut down it making it unplayable because ""His Cat got to it""

I started crying as the boy demanded his Pokémon game back, now I had played it and saved it by mistake but no more than catching a few Pokémon (like pidgey level shit he already had) etc ...HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO KICK OFF AT ME FOR THAT! The games tainted now because he didn't do it all himself  he says then  He pushed me, I pushed him back, I was a wee bit stronger than him so he fell the teacher saw and suddendly I had detention not him.

Detention in that school year meant when everyone else was playing outside at lunchtime you were sitting in the class helping the teacher clean up sort of thing. this time however it was to decorate the lid of the time capsule we as a class where going to Bury later on that day....you see where this is going

 So at one point she sends me to the coat room to get something from the supply cupboard and i went past the boys bag, the same boy who ruined my brand new game and then pushed me and got me in trouble and I noticed in the side pocket was his precious Pokémon Gold game...so in a fit of anger I pocketed it, and as I was sitting decorating the lid of the time capsule box I put it inside the box and covered it up with the other items, you know just pretending I was being nosey at the contents kind of thing.

He doesn't notice, we buried it, he realizes later on at hometime he hasn't got it, accuses me of taking it. His mum says to my mum 'err my kid said your kid stole something of his can you check his coat and bag' 

She asked me if I had it and ofc i said no so My mum said 'my son says he didn't take it so he didn't take, if it happens to turn up when I get home  he will be punished and I'll bring it in tomorrow but I trust him and  I will NOT embarrass him by searching his bag in front of every kid and parent here like you're the fucking Gestapo' 

The woman said 'oh I thought we were friends because you had good Christian morals like me  but clearly you'd rather just let your son steal things.' 

I said ' I didn't take his game but he broke mine look!!'

As I presented my spyro game, his mother goes 'you probably did that yourself to cover up stealing my son's game as it costs more'

My mum went fucking nuts at her so called friend and to calm them down I goes 'here my pockets are empty, the teacher can check my bag it's fine'

Ofc the search turned up nothing. My mum didn't get an apology from the woman and they never spoke again. 

So yeah that's how I stole a kids game and Buried it and ruined one of the few friendships my mum ever had 

Do I feel guilty? No, not really I know it was morally wrong and two wrongs dont make a right and that even though he was a little prick he had an emotional connection to the Pokémon on the game and probably cried for weeks but I don't feel bad about it at all, as it got him and his nasty mum out our lives. 

What I do feel bad and guilty for is lying to my mum, and my fresh into his first job at 17 cousin hearing about my new game and using the bulk of his first ever paycheck to buy me a new one because he knew my mum didn't have the money to replace it- yeah I know that likely would've happened regardless of what I did because of what he did. But I felt so guilty holding onto the lie that I felt I didn't deserve it

I never did tell my mum but when I was 12/13 I told my cousin about it and said sorry he wasted his money on me  he just said 
'nah that's fucking hilarious man, if you had told me back then I'd have brought you the Pokémon Game as well just to mess with the annoying fuck'",2022-04-27 02:03:29

I started living with him in 2019 or so not really sure, this all started ordering food, one day i realised he had paid for the food as we had say i wpuld send him the money, well i completly forgot it, and so did he, once i realised we both had forgotten instead of telling him i kept my money because im a fucking bastard, i honestly got no excuse but being a cheap bastard, is true i maybe was going low on money at that time but is still no excuse, i ordered the food, if i didn't had enough it was my problem not him. Worst part is i did it a few times more, i would ask him if he would want something to dinner fully knowing he would forget to ask me for my money.

I feel like total shit he is not only one of the best friends i ever had, but he is also a wonderfull person who i no way deserved to be betrayed like that, damn i love him like if he was my family, he has said many times that im like a lil brother for him, im worthless piece of shit who has betrayed the trust of one of the best persons i ve ever meet. 

I dont know how many times i did it, or when i stopped my best bet it was like 3 to 4 years ago, since then i haven't had the courage to tell him because im ashamed of what i did, he could cut me out, he has good reasons to do so i couldnt blame him.

I feel like I no longer can hide it, i have to tell him the truth, and honestly im so fucking scared of doing so, i could lose him forever, i have been a shitty friend, no excuse.

This weekend i was deeply in depression, not by this im just going throught depression.  He offered me to pay me a taxi to go to his local so i could be with people and stop thinking about my depression, and in fact even thought i told him to dont do it he ended up having to pay because i didn't have enough money to pay the taxi once i arrived, he told me to dont worry about it but i told him i would pay him back as soon as i could, and i did, but the thought came again, i could not pay him and he wouldn't know. 

When i thought that i felt like shit, how could I even think of doing so again to such a beautiful person, since then i can just keep pushing out the guilt of what I did. He is a great persons and deserves to know it, i gotta tell him, i cant even ask for forgiveness, i can just say how fucking bad i felt for it.

I have been a coward all this time, i felt so guilty and scared of losing him that i couldnt tell him the truth, but i can no longer hide it. I felt like this has been one of the worst mistakes of my life.",2022-04-26 22:37:45
I used to throw big houseparties without any concern for the house,502,uc62md,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/uc62md/i_used_to_throw_big_houseparties_without_any/,51,1650954099.0,"I (24M) used to regurlarly host big houseparties when I was a teen. Almost anyone was allowed in, even if I didnt know them.
Ofcourse it always ended up in a mess. Items was sometimes broken or ruined. My dad’s cigar collection was raided (and misused) and everything would be really dirty. I always considered it a scaled down version of project X without all of the total mass destruction.

My parents constantly told me not to for obvious reasons, but I didnt care. I was always really good at cleaning (as my mom taught me), but ofcourse its not enough when stuff gets ruined.

I made some amazing memories, but in hindsight, I realise that I just did it for social credit. Trying to be cool and all that.
I dont regret hosting the parties, but I do regret not respecting my parents and taking more responsibility for keeping the parties under control",2022-04-26 09:21:39

It was December 2017 when me and my friends went out to the local neighborhood to run around different flats and knock on people doors or do some other shit that basically made people go mad. And one of my friends decided to start throwing bricks at a street lamp for fun, we thought it’s all good cos it was dark and there was no one on the street. After he was done we went to get something to drink and got into a flat to get warmer because it was a snowy winter. 10 minutes in we noticed a lady 2 floors above us that was speaking to someone on the phone about some thugs running around and breaking stuff. We got scared that she might’ve noticed us and maybe even recorded the whole action. We went upstairs to make sure that she wasn’t talking about us but turned out she was on the phone with her son when she saw us come up and quickly cut our way back down off speaking to her son “come on come up here quicker they’re here !” We we’re already shitting ourselves and had no idea what to do. The lady was about 60-70 years old so we didn’t want to do anything that could hurt her but before any other thoughts i rammed her and she fell down a couple stairs shouting at us. We ran straight down and out of the building . When we started running through the flat i looked back to see if she was okay, she looked fine to me so we escaped. I don’t know where she is today and i hope she’s alive and well. I regret it because it must’ve hurt her. Im sorry lady I learnt from my mistakes and got some better friends now. I’m now almost 18 years old and surrounded by better people and know how to do good and i’m a changed person but i won’t forgive myself for hurting an elder.

Edit: I thought Hit and Run means “knock and run” cos that’s what i did",2022-04-25 17:59:55

Now there was this kid who always had this box of over 100 crayons in it. I'm talking like Craz-e-Art and Crayola. My friend (let's call him dave) and I hated that he had the good crayons. This kid never bragged about them, we were just mad he had them. So Dave an I would stick around after everyone was at lunch we would go to his desk (they were fold-up desks) and break his crayons. It got to the point where he would have to bring in a new box of crayons every 2 weeks. The teacher had to lecture us about it. Now I know breaking a kids crayons wasn't a lot, but the thing is that me and this kid were friends. Like I knew stuff about him that nobody else knew. When the teacher caught us, I told her that it was Dave's idea. Dave didn't know what to say. So he just took the fall. He got grounded for 1 and a half months for it and I got off scot free. I was told that the kid who's crayons we were breaking, found out that I was in on it. I had already moved schools before he found out. I never apologized to either one of them. I sit with that regret every day. Lost 2 of my best friends just because I didn't like his crayons.

Then we met there when i was eating at the cafetaria(she became surprisingly very attractive and pretty at least in my opinion), i talked to her first, first encounter was very awkward but i managed to break the ice, then we became friends. That is a lie if i say i didnt care about her, we hung out alot with my friends and her friends(sometimes i hung out with her friends, sometime she hung out with my boys). And out of nowhere i developed feelings for her, she became my crush so i told her to be my gf, she amazingly agreed to that and she said she also had feelings for me and i asked if she forgave me for the bullying that i did, she did.

I must have gotten distracted because the next thing I knew I was practically on top of the van ahead of me that had stopped. I hadn't been paying attention. And in that millisecond before I ran into the van, my mind was so panicked that I couldn't even remember where the gas was and where the break was. I mean I'm talking this was a millisecond, but my brain had time to think, if I  press on the gas by mistake, I will make this crash worse. So, I just left my car run into the van.  I was so close, and going so slowly that there was no visible damage to the van.

 We pulled over and the Van turned out to be a church van with several church members in it. The driver was very angry. Stupidly I started saying no, I understand, it's my fault... I learned later I should not have just blurted that out. Not that it mattered.

 My son was also in the car in his car seat, he was probably about 4.  He was scared that we were pulled over and everything that was happening. By the time we left the scene, fire trucks actually showed up, and I think an ambulance, and one of the church members was sitting in the ambulance. I mean that was completely ridiculous, there is zero chance anyone was injured (which indeed turned out to be the case). 

 We exchanged information and all that. I knew though that my husband would be mad at me and that it would be an embarrassing story to tell. So,  there was an investigation, I think by the insurance company. Forgive me if the details are a little blurry here. But what I do remember is having to go to an office and give a statement with 2 lawyers there, about what happened.  It was like being in court, they were asking me questions, the lawyer assigned to me had warned me just to answer the questions and don't embellish or elaborate, et cetera.

And I had decided to lie and just say that it was stop and go traffic and the Van ahead of me had stopped short, he had stopped abruptly, and then I ran into the Van. I took any fault of mine out of the picture. To sum up, the investigation settled and it was found that there was no fault involved. 

I never told anyone, when relating this story, that it was really my fault.",2022-04-23 17:12:10
I used to physically hurt my baby brother out of sheer frustration,1333,u9xqnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/u9xqnv/i_used_to_physically_hurt_my_baby_brother_out_of/,168,1650689789.0,"I never hit my little brother before, until he was around three. I love him to death, and to this day I can’t understand why I did it ever at all. 

When covid started and online schooling began, I was 16 and a junior. My baby brother, about three at the time, was now in my possession because he didn’t like his babysitter and she didn’t want to take care of children any longer out of fear of getting the virus, understandable. I agreed to this because I was used to taking care of him. I took care of him more than his dad spent time with him.

Well, fast forward to maybe a few months. He wasn’t a horrible child at all. He was a sweet, kind, fun, loving baby and showed me everything he thought was cool and just wanted to play. Since all of us in the family were older than him, he felt more alone. 

Yet, whenever he’d do a normal child thing like spill milk because he wasn’t thinking or throw things for attention, I would yank him by the hair or spank his bottom. There was two times I heard a pop when I pulled his hair and I can’t get over it…all because I was a moody teen. 

His pained cries haunt me and make me cry myself to sleep, even worse was when I’d open my arms to apologize, he’d run right to me and cry into my shoulder, and I’d cry quietly instantly regretting it like a little bitch. I stopped the second time I pulled his hair too hard, I remember it so vividly. I cried so much because it took me so long to finally stop being so angry and calm down before dealing with him. 

I want to apologize to him but he’s only almost 5 and still loves me to death, he chooses me over everyone else in the family. The remorse eats at me everyday. I choke up just thinking about this. I just wish I’d never done it but I can’t undo it. 

It really eats at me that he still misses me and talks about me everyday since i moved out almost a year ago.

EDIT: I no longer live with him and haven’t in almost a year. Whenever I visit him, he always wants to play and talk to me and no one else in the family, and it really strikes me how he could. I know I didn’t hit him mostly but I also would think he’d remember it. 

Anyway, the fact that he cries when I leave and asks my sister “When is she coming back? Can she stay for a long time?” is what’s really messing with me…I don’t know if he doesn’t remember because he was so young but I remember abuse all the way from when I was 2. 

thank you all for the brutal honesty and i’m somewhat shocked some people are being understanding of my situation.

edit2: sorry i had to add; i’m thinking of moving back there with him because he’s also mistreated by our mom and his older brother is such a dick to him. i know i won’t let my frustrations out on him this time bc it stopped a little less than halfway through the time i was watching him. 

no one really cares about him and his well-being, just an annoying child who gets bought toys when he wants it and gets hurt, almost like an exchange. i’m grateful he doesn’t get beat at all the way i was everyday, but i can see the light in his eyes and his personality dulling and it hurts so much to see…i’m not sure about moving back yet though. thanks all.",2022-04-23 07:56:29

Later that evening, a friend of mine shows up to hang out at my apartment and I go to show him the damage - only to find that the bumper had popped back into place. 

If you looked closely, you might be able to find a couple scuff marks indicating the outer boundaries of where the bumper was caved in but that's it. There was no evidence that I'd been in an accident.

When I was in third grade I stole two Matchbox cars from the local grocery store,28,u97smq,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/u97smq/when_i_was_in_third_grade_i_stole_two_matchbox/,9,1650607999.0,"I was with my mother on a shopping trip, and I opened two individual packages of Matchbox cars and snuck them into my pockets when no one was looking. At the time, we lived on an old farmhouse property, about 2 acres with light forest. 

I waited until I had to go to bed to take them out of my pockets because I was so scared of getting caught. I always played on the edges of the property, which were enclosed by an approximately 4' tall chain link fence. I even had a fort I built from sticks. 

The day after I played with the cars for the first time in the dark, I was so terrified of the FBI (the FBI!!! lol) coming to investigate me I hid the cars in my backpack and went to school. I was on edge the whole day, thinking the cops were going to walk in the classroom at any minute, or I would get called to the principal's office and they would be waiting for me. 

After I walked home, I went to the edge of the property to my fort and threw both of the cars into the neighboring field and prayed no one would find them. 

I never got caught, and I even eventually told my parents (and was scolded appropriately), but to this day I still feel more guilty about that than almost anything else. 

The properties were later developed into condos, but as far as I know, those little Matchbox cars are still there. Maybe centuries or millennia from now, an archaeologist will find them and wonder. I like to think I've made my contribution to history.",2022-04-22 09:13:19
"I used to regularly steal from a local shop, and the girl behind the register knew me but never said anything.",45,u8feja,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/u8feja/i_used_to_regularly_steal_from_a_local_shop_and/,5,1650515923.0,"When I was younger, say like probably 9 maybe a bit younger, I used to regularly go into this rock candy shop (one of a hundred in my town, the touristy type) and I'd take two of those round rainbow swirly spiral lollypops off the counter, go to a corner, put one in my bag then put one back and leave. I used to walk to the library so I'd go on the way, or on the way back from church (I get the irony). I never took anything else, though i think maybe once or twice i took 3 lollipops off the counter and put 2 in my bag. I can't really remember.

I knew the girl behind the counter from church, and her mum knew mine (from church again). She was probably like 16. She had to know. There's no fucking way she didn't notice. I was no child genuis. I did it on several occasions, but she never said anything.

I don't even remember the first time I did it, or why I thought it would be a good idea. We weren't on the poverty line, though we did struggle with money. My mum definitely would not have given me money to buy crap like that, and my family was not the type to give pocket money.  

I do remember why I stopped. My mum kind of sussed me out because I was goddawful liar, and I must have been acting suspicious. I remember to this day the pure fear of the idea of her finding out. I don't think I'd ever gotten that anxious whilst stealing, but the idea of my mum finding out? Terrified. She put the fear into me that day. Scared the ever loving shit out of me, saying how I'd be put in Juvie, how it'd be on my record for life. I don't think consequences had even been thought about, let alone considered.

Pretty sure it altered my being on a subconcious level. When I was younger I feel like I was a pretty carefree kid, but I am terrified of failure, getting in trouble, and the possible consequences of that. I have adhd and I always wonder if that event is what changed me from being a rambunctious troublemaking type to the inattentive anxious ridden type. I didn't really rediscover the side of me that's addicted to adrenaline until recently. 

These days I'm a burnt out gifted kid struggling my way through Uni. Despite how things went down, I wouldn't change it. Maybe get me to learn the lesson in a better way, without the theft, but other than that, nothing. Same way with the subsequent depression, suicidalness, anxiety and shit that my genetics gifted me at age 11. It shaped me into the person I am today, and despite the fact that I hate myself, I think I'd be worse off and a much shittier person if I hadn't gone through it. 

It had to happen that way. I wouldn't have learnt my lesson otherwise. I remember trying to take a piece of gum out of a packet of juicyfruit once in a tesco express and i think one of my parents saw me and got suspicious and warned me but it didn't do anything. It wouldn't have gotten through to me unless it was traumatic, or at least bordering on it. 

I've never been in that shop since, I don't go to church anymore and we've moved so I don't see the girl or her mum at all. When I am in town, I give the shop a wide berth. It's one of those things that gives me a shit ton of anxiety if I think back to it but overall, I wouldn't change it. I wouldn't have changed my actions otherwise and who knows where or even who I'd be.",2022-04-21 07:38:43

And that I was so lucky to have any friends at all. Am I in the wrong?,2022-04-17 22:10:10

It was afternoon and all of the students are cleaning the backyard of the school. Further than that is a garbage dump where all of the trash of the school is thrown, it was huge. This was a Christian school btw.

A boy told everyone that there is a snake lurking, so they all began to throw rocks at the big dump since we were all kids and gullible. 

I wanted to join the fun, so I got a fist-sized rock and threw it in the air. As a kid not knowing about trajectory, the rock landed exactly on a boy, let's call him Jasper. 

I approached him to see if he's okay, his head was already bleeding. Nobody saw me threw the rock, only me and him knew I was the suspect. My heart was pumping rapidly, almost as if I killed someone.

I quickly ran back to my post and pull some grass so I can pretend nothing happened. Another kid noticed Jasper and approached him, he told the teachers that I did it. The teachers doubted him as he is a naughty boy.

I bet you're thinking ""nah, you're gonna get caught"" but no, I wasn't. 

In our school, we have a hierarchy of the smartest kids being tagged as kind, behave, and respected while less intelligent kids are foreshadowed and unnoticed. I was one of the smartest kids on school. So I used my privileged perk to escape sentence.

The teachers turned a blind eye on me since I was ""peacefully"" pulling grass and being a good boy, or so they think. 

When it was over, I quickly grabbed my bag and went home fast, I was stopped by a lot of students demanding that I must apologize for what I've done, Ha! They don't have PROOF.

I didn't tell my parents about it, I was sweating a lot at that time during the process. Back at school, our teacher just told us to be careful and went on teaching like nothing happened.",2022-04-17 17:54:45

(we had to give it back at the end) anyways i ended up with more money because i was more convincing. the other girl was whining so she had us us draw mustaches to see which one was more similar. i draw one that looks completely different from the other one and the other girl draws one that looks like the one i drew before because she didn’t get what we were doing. so it was decided that she was definitely guilty. the other girls shunned her for the rest of the night and i got to play with them like i was their best friend. they never found out it was me and i feel bad about it because i still go to school with both the girls house we were at and her older sister. every time i see them i get really nervous.",2022-04-17 05:01:09

Nobody got out of the car so fortunately for me I assume it was empty. I was too much of a coward to go check up their window. However I'm concerned if there was a child inside that could tell their parents. I'm afraid I just did a hit and run, although I kept the spot so they could check my licence if they ever have doubts. I'm also scared that they could vandalize my car in retaliation.

1:he smokes on the balcony and just chucks his buds out

2:he doesn’t like his cat

3: his demeanour towards his wife/girlfriend is always shock

4:he doesn’t know anyone is watching him so he kicks his cat often


So I have been practicing marksmanship by hitting things on his balcony (glasses, clothes, cig packs)

So yesterday I was watching him and I saw him dangling his cat over his balcony (he’s 8 floor I’m 10 floor opposite building)
And so I had to watch as he held his cat by the legs and shook him.
This I the part I feel bad about, I set up stuff to block vision to me (clothes etc) and then started shooting him .
Now I use a Fairly strong rifle, to be exact the gsg 4410 spring rifle.
So after about seven shots I hit a shot finally and hit him in the eye.
From what I know he has a patch on his eye and no one saw me.

Passed few weeks have been a Rollercoaster of emotions just turned 18 months ago, I have a month and few weeks of school left ect... lots of pressure happening. Couple hours ago as I was walking home after I ran for bout 45 minutes as my workout and I got a phone call from Texas.
Picked up the phone and I and said calmly Hello? End of the line the voice said remember me son? It was my father and all of a sudden I was surprised that he decided to call me all of a sudden. ( Last connection we ever had was about 6 years ago. This was when I was in 6th grade now I'm a senior 7 weeks away from graduating ) 
I could feel my heart pumping really fast as I was holding my phone talking with my father who I haven't heard from in years.

Background: My parents Mom(23) now 43 and Dad(22) now 42 at the time met. Mom was fresh out of college and my father never went to college and started working right after highschool. My Dad actually didn't want to leave the house one time and inviting my mom his gf at the time over and well they hit that same day ( also the last no protection nothing ) fast forward 3 months later my mom found out she was pregnant at a party and she was bouncing around in the jumper not knowing what pregnancy or being pregnant felt like until my grandma told her she was pregnant ( I was almost 4 months old in her womb at the time ) 

Moving on:
Minutes passed by I think it was about 4:15pm pacific time and my father said how's life been and I just said it was amazing until you decided to call. I know this was rude of me but knowing what I've gone through 18 years 3 months and 13 days without having a father in my life it felt miserable and really felt like he was dead to me.

Another Background: left my mom for another girl when I was 6 months old around July 2004? Left my mom depressed and miserable having to take care of me by myself all these years no one to help us besides my family and my grandparents from my dad's side. Always lied to me about how he promised to do some father and son bonding and never did it, never got phonecalls for him on holidays and birthdays life was just terrible. 

His voice changed within seconds after I told him what I said and I broke down in tears letting out what I had to say he knows what he's done but never thought he would here that from his own son's mouth before and told him that I've told my friends that he died in an accident 6 years ago that last time I saw of heard from him. Really does sometimes make me think that I would end up like him someday and as his son( probably not his only son ) and having the same blood as him, same face like he looked when he was my age sometimes it puts me to fear that I would be like my dad in the future?

It would be amazing to leave some suggestions for me too do in the future because I'm supposed to see him this year and it'll be amazing to hear some advices that I can take notes of for anything In the future.",2022-04-14 08:25:39

I have been compulsively lying for a huge portion of my life. Most if not all of them are about personal stories and things I've done in my ""past"" or friends that don't exist. I think the core reason of why I do so is so that I seem cooler or more interesting than I really am. Whenever I catch myself doing it, it seems so stupid. I always fear that my lies are catching up to my or people realize how full of shit I am. I'm sure they do. I've made it a note to stop this habit and be honest with myself. I'm average or less. It's not that big of a deal really. I've started doing this since like high school, maybe even middle school. My lies have not been so extreme, but it really makes me feel like shit in the end.

I've been seeing this girl for a few months now, as friends but kinda intimate, and I've realized that I've lied to her so much and was completely unnecessary. I've told her that:

\- I've been in a fight recently. I literally do not know why. I guess it was to seem tougher and to make her more interested. This is the one that's been hurting me the most lately. I told her about some fights early in my life that didn't happen at all either.

\- I've told her I've worked with producers and make some samples and bits together. This one was a stretch, I have seen some producers and engineers and chilled with them for a bit, but never really worked on anything with them.

I've probably said a lot more that's not coming to mind right now. I feel like shit. honestly. It may not seem like a big deal, but I hate the fact that I do this. I'm trying to stop and confessing here to make it a note that this will stop now. Sorry to the people who knew me and had to hear me spout on with my lies.

\*As an update: I told her that i lied about some things and i had no reason to. She was very understanding and actually laughed it off.

All of my teachers used BrainPop, and usually introduced new subjects (like cells, or algebra) with a BrainPop video.

6th grade was a hard year for me. My parents had lost their house, and it would take a few years before we had the funds to live on our own. My great-grandparents took us in, but we still didn't have any money to spare for luxuries like Netflix subscriptions or movie rentals... 

When I tried to use BrainPop at home for the first time, I was crushed to find it hidden behind a paywall. I knew damn well that the only BrainPop videos I would see would be at school. I would never be able to choose a BrainPop video to watch; I'd only ever see what my teachers chose to show us. 

One day in computer lab, our teacher was going around the room manually logging us into BrainPop to watch a specific video. She told us all the school username to enter, and would type in the password for each of us... But even though she had us all cover our eyes and turn around while typing the password, I still heard how many keys she pressed: 6.

The username was literally just the school email. And I managed to guess that the password was just as simple: the school name. I'm pretty sure it was all lowercase, too.

I felt like a goddamn computer genius when I typed the incredibly simple username/password into BrainPop. I felt like I'd discovered Pompeii, or the Teacher's Lounge.

I must have watched damn near every motherfucking BrainPop. Or it must have been something close, because for the rest of middle school I never saw a single BrainPop in class that I was unfamiliar with. I felt the smuggest sense of satisfaction to know that the password never changed, even after I moved to a new school district.

I never told anyone about my illegal BrainPop activities, not even my best friend.",2022-04-14 02:19:41

One of them (let’s call them Adam) was tossing a lacrosse ball against the court’s wall by himself. Adam continued to play around with the ball for a few minutes until me and my other friend (let’s call him Mark) suddenly heard a loud crash. We rushed over to where the sound came from and found Adam completely dumbfounded. He was staring at a hole in the wall that was just the size of a lacrosse ball. He told us he was messing around with the ball and accidentally threw it a bit too hard. I pulled out my phone and opened Snapchat so I could use the camera’s flashlight to get a good view inside the hole. After pushing my phone through the hole and taking a picture, I extracted it. My friends and I examined the photo and to no surprise the lacrosse ball was imbedded inside the wall. Jokingly, I requested to post a photo of the hole to my story with the caption “Adam did it”. Both of them laughed at this idea and while there were mixed emotions in this decision, they eventually had no problem with it. Mark, who owned the lacrosse equipment was furious that he lost his ball. He yanked the stick from Adam and tried plying the wall off in an attempt to retrieve his ball. Time after time, he jabbed the lacrosse stick into the wall until it finally cracked. I’m not sure how it got to this point (my friends either insisted it or I did it myself. I forgot), but I ended up kicking the crack until it eventually broke off into a large piece. I didn’t have the intent of breaking it in order to retrieve the ball, but rather to just break it in general. I figured that out about myself when Mark called out, “Got my ball back!” and it made me realize that was the whole point of breaking the wall in the first place. Mark’s words sparked an idea in my head. I posted another picture of the hole captioned, “Got my ball back”. This time however, they didn’t disagree with whether or not I should post it. (Reminder: I asked them both if I should post the photos before doing so) After looking at what we’ve done, we felt bad because school had just repaired these walls after the last time they were destroyed. Mark jokingly pieced the wall back together as if it was never broken. I then posted a picture of the repaired wall with the caption, “Adam fixed it.” (If it isn’t made clear, we are purposely “blaming” Adam to an extent that is clearly noticeable as a joke) This didn’t last long however, because we continued to knock down the “fixed” part of the wall until it chipped away more wall. At this point, we realized we were only damaging the wall more and they called ME out for it. Although I participated in the destruction and I fully understand what I did was wrong, I didn’t start it and I feel like I shouldn’t be the only one to blame. I wouldn’t call this selfish of me because Mark has a history of fully blaming things on me even though he started them. I’m not sure who caused the most damage to the wall, but I know it was equally all of our faults (they thought otherwise). Out of no where, Mark started chucking rocks out of his lacrosse sticks at the wall, forming new holes. I also took part in this, throwing one rock.  At this point, I was scared of getting caught so we left. While leaving, I saw two older boys who had seen the whole thing on the other side of the court. They didn’t see our faces because of the darkness and nor did it seem like they cared, but I still freaked me out.

Today, my mom texted me. She forwarded a message sent out by my town informing the residents of our vandalism. Then she asked if I knew anything of this incident because she knew we were out that day. I replied by claiming we saw the damage when we arrived at the court, but had nothing to do with it. I lied to her. My own mother. I feel horrible for it. I don’t want to confess to her or the school, but I want to get the guilt out of my head. It is killing me. I feel so bad for it and I know it was wrong. I am scared the people who saw my story will tell the head of my town. Please tell me how to overcome this guilt.",2022-04-13 01:55:38
I used to hurt my sister growing up as revenge for my dad.,88,u27faf,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/u27faf/i_used_to_hurt_my_sister_growing_up_as_revenge/,39,1649792187.0,"Ok so first yes it was 100% wrong and I don’t want to justify what I did. Her and I have a great relationship now and have healed from the years before. 

Growing up I was the youngest of two. My sister about 5 years older was always my dad’s favorite. She did great in school and was super social and well adjusted. I was not like her at all. 

The reason for this was we had extremely different childhoods. She was always with her friends and going to parties while I was always left home alone. My dad didn’t believe boys should have much of a social life and put me to work at a really young age. She would spend her weekends at the beach or riding horses and I would spend them digging ditches in the hot sun. Keep in mind in was 8 at this time. 

The punishments we got were different too. My dad would beat the hell out of me with his hands or his belt or whatever really. I remember failing a math test in the 8th grade and my dad held me against the wall screaming he was gonna knock my teeth out then slapped the shit out of me. But while he would do all that to me, he would never lay a hand on my sister. He didn’t yell at her or get angry. Just talk to her. 

So as time went on I grew to resent her. It wasn’t her fault but in my childhood mind it was. I would shoot her with my BB gun or make our cat mad then toss him at her. I even shot her in the leg once with a bow and arrow. I was truly horrible to her. 

We are adults now and have worked though this. She’s an amazing sister and somehow found it in her to forgive me. But the guilt has never gone away. I’m so happy to have her in my life I’m just so sorry I made it so hard to have this relationship.",2022-04-12 22:36:27
I abused you and the guilt is weighing down on my conscience.,44,u27d4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/u27d4b/i_abused_you_and_the_guilt_is_weighing_down_on_my/,23,1649792024.0,"

When you first came into my life it was the first time that I felt genuine love by somebody other than my family.

Not only did you accept me for who I was, but you made me feel like I was someone good with redeeming qualities. 

I knew that you were a troubled person and that you needed help. I truly wanted to help you get better and you said I did. When I first saw the cuts in your arm I wanted to die. When you said that without me you would have committed suicide, I never felt so glad to have met you.

We loved each other both as people and romantically. You were my first everything. My first kiss, my first hug, my first love and my first sexual partner. 

You were so pretty and charming and kind and thoughtful. You still are I bet. You’re one of the all around best people I have met. 

You made me feel such intense emotions and such passion.

When you got better and stopped self harming I felt so proud.

I was still young back then though, I could not handle my emotions and I could not handle the fact that people change and have desires other than my own.

I abused you verbally often and manipulated you into doings things that you did not want to. 

I hurt your feelings and ignored your needs.

I forced you to stop going out without my approval and isolated you from people that cared about you.

I did not care about how I made you feel and what you wanted.

I felt so threatened by everything that could change our relationship and let my insecurities and bad tendencies guide me.

I gaslighted you into staying with me and ruined your spirits. I know for a fact that you hated yourself for months for being together with me.

When you finally broke up with me I felt so betrayed and heartbroken. I could not understand how you could do that to me. I thought you loved me and that I did not deserve that treatment. I could not see the person I had become and how badly I treated you.

When you blocked me I felt so desperate. We never talked for a last time, you just vanished without any rhyme or reason (at least that’s what I thought). I tried for months to contact you thinking that something was wrong. It turns out that I was wrong and I could not see it. In hindsight you probably were terrified and afraid.

I deserved all the consequences of my actions. After my first outbursts I gave up. I’m
Still ashamed of the things that I thought and said about you. You deserved better. I’m ashamed of how I handled our break up.


When I heard that you moved on my heart broke. But then I started to gather the shattered pieces and built a better one.

I slowly realised how abusive I became and the mistakes that I made. I started wanting to become a better person all around, especially with regards of how I treat others. 

I never tried to keep our common friends. I was too ashamed and knew that you deserved them.

We haven’t talked for years. And I think it’s for the best. You probably despise me and with good reason. I was despicable to you and I can never change that. 

I don’t wish to keep in touch despite your qualities. I moved on and I’m trying to be good and moral. I don’t know how you handled your affairs, but I’m sure that you don’t need a remainder of how terribly you were treated. I just hope that you’re leading a happy and healthy life. You deserve it without even taking into account how I abused you. 

I know you have spoken badly of me and told secrets of ours and insulted me, you also detailed how I treated you with some embellishment. I don’t blame you though and I don’t hold it against you. I treated you terribly and I don’t deserve your secrecy and discretion. I know that some people think down on me because of what you said but I understand that you did that out of the pain and harm that I caused you. I don’t mind loosing a few friends especially after how terrible of a person I was. 

I don’t think you think of me anymore. I was rather bland if you forget the abuse. I don’t know if you care about forgiving me and I even though I would like for that to be the case it doesn’t eat me up. I just hope to cause the least amount of harm and most amount of good that I can. I’m sorry for everything and I hope you’re well. I would never send this to you because I don’t want to cause any more hurt to you however I do feel intense guilt from time to time. Just know that no of it was your fault. I was just horrible and inexcusable.

PS: (the only thing I have to say that you could have done better is that you could have left earlier but I know that it was hard and that I was manipulative. In any case I should have understood how much I hurt you but I didn’t.",2022-04-12 22:33:44

I for some reason took a picture of both the stakes and showed Zach. Now I had no idea that this was a thing back then. Hand to God I had no idea that it was a thing I just wanted to be quirky and different.

Fast forward to when I was 10 I moved houses and I became best friends with my neighbor. Let’s just call her Ally. Ally had a brother and we can call him James. Ally’s brother suffers from a disease that causes him to be hyperactive. I dont remember the name of it. James was really mean to me. Even though he is like 4 years younger than me. The things he would say to me were really mean. For example, he would constantly make fun of the fact that my dad passed away. Which made me angry to the point where I would hit him. One time, me, my friend, and her brother were outside playing. James was on his bike and he rolled past me and said something about my dad, like always. It finally ticked me off enough to where I ran towards him, grabbed the back of his shirt, and pulled him off of his bike. He fell, obviously. But he started bleeding and ran inside his house. His sister yelled at me, pretty much saying “why would you do that?!” And “are you insane?!” I looked at her and said “he deserved it, he shouldn’t be talking about my DEAD dad like that.” Ally ran inside after him and I went home crying.

I then began to Feel guilty and stopped. Since my grandma was so nice she never really did anything about it .

The class had just finished reading a novel, and so everyone was tasked with writing up a report including the summary, theme, cited works, etc. It was the day the assignment was due, and this girl was being a jerk to everyone. Just so you know, she is normally a jerk, but she was on another level - probably experiencing family problems or something as her parents had recently divorced.

Anyway, a few days prior, I had witnessed her write down something on a piece of paper. She then handed it to a classmate, and the classmate read it and then proceeded to throw it away. Naturally, I went and grabbed it out of the trash can, and I was shocked to see the paper read: “Email Password: kittycats”

What a dumb password… but either way I now knew what it was.

Back to present time (the due date of the presentation).

I opened a new tab and logged into Google docs as her, and could see her making live edits. Naturally, I would press backspace a few times whenever she was typing, or move her cursor somewhere else on the doc while she was revising… standard stuff.

Anyway, after a few minutes, she calls over the teacher. Of course I stopped, and that make the teacher think this girl was crazy, which her ego needed. Then as the teacher walked away, I used the text replace tool to change every “the” and “a” into “Im an idiot.”

She ended up fixing it in the end but seeing her spend nearly the whole class trying to fix the mistakes in her document was hilarious. 

As all pranks should be, no one got hurt, but her ego went from enough for the whole town to barely enough for one person… I know this because she didn’t bully anyone for months after that.

I told her it was me almost 4 months later on the last day of school. She went in for a punch as I hopped on my bike and rode home. Never saw her again.",2022-04-09 07:17:02
I stole money from a rich prep school kid when I was in high school,282,tzk3c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/tzk3c4/i_stole_money_from_a_rich_prep_school_kid_when_i/,66,1649473436.0,"I stole money from a super rich prep school kid and I feel bad to this day.

From 10th through 12th grade I worked summers for a painting company. The place we painted every summer is a very famous and renowned prep school in New England for super rich kids. 

The summer of my second year there I started out painting the dorm rooms first. All of the rooms came with some standard furniture. A bed and a roll top desk. We were required to clean out all the garbage the kids left behind and scrape the tape gum and boogers off the wall before we started painting. Including cleaning out the desk drawers. 

These kids were rich little pricks most of the time. They wrecked the rooms and were generally disgusting slobs who made no effort to clean up before they went home or to Europe for the summer. They looked at us like maids and generally looked down their noses at us regular kids who had to work for a living. 
I was cleaning a room and opened a drawer in the desk. There was a wallet in the  drawer. It had no ID in it but had 80 dollars in cash in it. I pocketed the cash and threw the wallet in the bottom of my giant bag full of disgusting trash and put the bag in the dumpster. This was the day after kids had gone home for the summer. About an hour later my boss who was a nasty old pervert anyway and stank of BO came in and grilled us all about whether we had found a wallet in one of the rooms. He knew which rooms we had been assigned to so he grilled me extra hard and looked me right on the eye while asking me if I had found the wallet. I looked him right back dead in the eyes and said “nope, didn’t find a thing but old papers and boogers” and I shrugged and went back to work. 

I never got caught and later that day I went out and bought half an ounce of weed with the money. My boyfriend and I had a great weekend with it. But I started feeling really bad a few days later and it’s haunted me ever since. 

I justified it to myself because they were rich kids and I wasn’t but I have felt bad about that for 30 years.  Because the indication was that that kid was in trouble for losing it. I was 3 years older than this kid and knew better.",2022-04-09 06:03:56

I just open the website where I'm meant to be doing this homework, and then play some video games instead because I'm bored asf and can't be  bothered to do work. My grandma walks into the room and with insane  reflexes I hit the Windows key and minimize the game window. She looks  at the website and gives a nod of approval, but then realises there's an  icon on the taskbar that's open. She asks what is (after recently  taking computing classes at around 77-ish years old) and I say it's just  some popup that's annoying me and to ignore it. It fooled her. Now  obviously this doesn't seem that deep and I lie to my parents all the  time which is why I spend hours a day on my PC supposedly doing ""lots of  homework they keep setting me"". But I feel real bad for my grandma  simply because she just cares for me so much and has done so many things  for me.

It was the very end fo the year in missouri and it was around 2018 so when its may in missouri its gets HOT and i remember this day was the first day above 95 degrees and so all of the cooling units were shut off due to matinence and overheating, meaning that there was no cooling so when you have 30+ kids in a class rooms with some people not showering any smell was heavily intense. I remember it was 5 period so right after lunch when my friend gave me the bottle and told me that it was too weak but he had said it in a sarcasim but he was covering his mouth which was confusing so i went with the best option and sprayed the whole bottle during the passing time well when you spray a WHOLE BOTTLE of synthetic ass it spreads slowly but strongly and pretty soon i could hear people in other people in classrooms gaging and laughing but then the laughs turned into gags too but i seemed to be the only person who heard them until 6th hour. i should also metion that i had payed $20 bucks for this bottle and i hated my school i was the kid to piss all over the restroom not bc i didnt know how to no hands but i just hated the fuckign school so i was trying not to laugh because i had got up to sharpen a pecil i stole from teh sped kid bc he was a bitch btu the pencil sharpener was up by the door and when i walked up i took a big and deep breath by the door and it was enough to make you stop walking and get light headed. and ways im taking up too much time but basically when it got to our home room(study time) people were begging to leave the building because it smelled like death so people started to think someone died adn school was cancelled for 2 days it turns out they had to pull the carpet out because the smell got stuck into it. so if you wanna go out with a bang jsut make sure its not a nuke lol.",2022-04-07 11:02:09

And me and my friend started to bully her, we also would bully her about the clothes she wore and her hair and how she looked. One day I had even put gum in her hair, and she had to cut her hair just to get it out. I don't know why I treated her the way I did, most days when I think about this, I wish I could've been her friend.

Again, the bullying continued in 4th grade as well. She eventually told a teacher, and I told the teacher she was lying and even got my friend to back me up and the teacher believed me and made her stay inside for recess, but I was mad at her for telling the teacher so the next day me and my friend devised a plan to get back at her. So, the next time it was recess we pretended we were sorry for the way we've been treating her and leaded her away from the teachers and pushed her into a mud puddle and her clothes were ruined. And she started crying so, me and my friend ran away so we wouldn't get in trouble. And when I got home, I told my older brother who told my mom and my mom forced me to write an entire apology and told me to give it to her the next day and grounded me for a month. But the next day I was supposed to give it to her, she wasn't there I asked the teacher about it, and she told the class that she had moved. I don't know where she moved, I don't know if she moved because of me or for some other reason, but whenever I think of the way I treated her It just ruins my day.

I hate myself for how I treated her, and I'm not sure if I can ever forgive myself and I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.

Edit: for all the comments telling me it's so easy to use social media to find her. News flash it's not Shes not the type of person to use social media and if she did, she wouldn't use it very often plus I don't even know her last name only her first and I don't know what she even looks like as that was like 8 years ago. If it was so easy to find her, I would've done so.",2022-04-04 03:26:44

It happened a lot but when we got older we confessed since we weren’t interested in Pokémon anymore. Still pretty funny to think about.,2022-04-03 02:45:10

When I got home mum made me release it with some other pukekos around the property. Now I’m going to assume that the baby died as I took it away from its parents.

I remember my anger gradually building up as he hurled one insult after another at me in front of our friends ( I too was hurling them back at him of course ), and when he went on to insult my mother...  I do not know what took over me. I ran after him. I was a rather well built 12 year old and he was a rather underweight, lanky one. I caught up with him, pushed him to the ground. 
I had wanted him to get a little hurt ( I did have malice in my heart when I pushed him ), but I had not intended for him to land on his wrist and end up breaking it.

When I was around 11-13 I was hanging out with some of my neighborhood friends (it was a neighborhood in Mexico so houses are more closer to each other) Me and 2 of my friends (let’s call them A and L) were just walking around our neighborhood just talking and playing around like all kids do, some time later we saw 2 other kids whom we knew but I wasn’t really close to (for the sake of the story they are S and G) we approached them and started talking to them, I think we were planning on what to play next, while we were talking, S accidentally pushed L to the ground and I completely lost it, I started lashing out at S mind you I was a few years older than him and was in sports so I was a bit stronger than him, anyways I pushed him many times and he fell and got back up and started running away, I kept chasing him while trying to punch him, some of them landed and some didn’t, he ended up being backed into a corner and that’s when my friends and G stopped me, I went for one final punch which grazed him on the nose and started bleeding. 

After my friends stopped me, my consciousness came back and I realized what I had done, feeling guilty and embarrassed I started crying too, this caught the attention of the other neighbors who heard all the screaming and went to check on us, one neighbor separated me and started walking me to my house while I was in tears trying to explain myself and regretting everything, when I finally got to my house my parents took me to S’s house to apologize which I did but I feel like I didn’t apologize enough.

Every now and then when I’m alone with my thoughts I remember how he was crying and begging me to stop, asking me why I was doing this and also hearing my friends yelling for me to stop, I hate myself for it because it was a traumatic experience for him and I never saw him the same again.

When I come back to that neighborhood when I’m on vacation I sometimes see him and try to be friendly but he still keeps his distance which I understand why, now that I have a little sibling his age I couldn’t imagine them being beat up like that.

At our school we had big charity raffles to raise funds for our music and arts programs, giveaways of toasters and a grand prize of a car type stuff. So each kid would be tasked with walking around their neighborhood selling the raffle tickets, to which the buyers would mail or drop off an envelope of cash with their order form directly to the school office. The school office kept these envelopes in a big box right next to the waiting room chairs next to the principals office, don’t ask me why. So one day while waiting to be disciplined for mouthing off to my teacher or causing a ruckus, I accidentally bumped the box and heard the change inside an envelope. An idea popped into my 4th grade mind… I very sneakily opened the letter without tearing it and emptied out the cash, leaving the order form inside and closed up the letter, to my shock about 40$ had appeared in my hands, I repeated this process to a few more letters until the principal called me into their office. I quickly realized that I could keep getting away with it as long as I kept getting in trouble, so my troublemaking gradually increased and I emptied out more and more of these envelopes, hiding the cash in an old report card envelope hidden under my mattress, this went on until 5th grade when they stopped doing these raffles. I don’t know wether it was my doing or not, but nobody ever said a word to me or raised suspicions about me. I took stock of my cash one late night using the a toy with a built in flashlight, and I counted over a thousand dollars.

Rough council estate and only one parent working in a care home, we didn’t have a lot. For some reason though, my mum wanted better for me and refused to send me to secondary school near where we lived. She sent me to this nicer secondary school in a more ‘well off area’ and I literally despised everyone there. I wasn’t the target of bullying or anything, not directly anyway, I got on well with people who were nice to me and didn’t tolerate shit from people who weren’t. I couldn’t stand this group of girls in my year, they were literally mini regina george’s reincarnated - typical high school mean girls with too much spare cash. My mum gave me a set amount of money every day for bus and lunch money but one week the bus prices went up and the money I got for lunch would have to go towards my bus money. One day after everyone had got changed for PE and headed out to play netball or whatever, I was the only one left in the changing room and realised that I only had money for lunch or the bus. As I was going outside I knocked into this girl’s blazer and heard a load of change rattling. I don’t know why I did it, but I just scooped it all out and took it with me. Solid £5 in 50p’s. I knew who’s blazer it was and I hated her, she picked on other girls a lot and was just generally a bitch. I enjoyed the luxury of having lunch and getting the bus home that day and I just never stopped doing it. When I finished getting ready for PE, i’d always find an excuse to hang back - going to the toilet, grabbing sports equipment etc and then i’d dash back into the changing rooms to scavenge people’s blazer pockets for change. I only ever stole from people who, in my eyes, deserved - it classic mean girls with too much spare change. I never took anything from anyone who I knew to be a nice person or didn’t have a lot of money, I didn’t even take anything from the nasty girls who I knew for a fact didn’t have a lot going for them. But if you were a bitch and I knew you had money, you were getting your pockets rinsed. I got clever at it, I never took the same person’s change twice and always made sure to leave some as not to arise suspicions. Not that they ever noticed, they’d just text daddy to put a fiver in their banks lol. In my second to last year of school one of the girls reported the theft, everyone got brought in for questioning and I straight up denied and said I didn’t have a clue what they were talking about. Nobody had any reason to suspect me, I was a PE representative and the school’s star cross country runner, the whole PE department loved me - I could’ve shot someone and they’d say thank you. So yea, after the questioning I started doing less and less and eventually just stopped and got a weekend job when I was old enough. I was stealing from these bitchy mean girls for like four years straight and they never even noticed, in my eyes I wasn’t causing any harm so why not. I do regret it now though, in hindsight I probably should’ve just told my mum the bus ticket prices went up and she would have definitely gave me more money.  I was young though and I knew how much she was struggling and didn’t want to put that pressure on her.",2022-03-30 22:43:20

When I was in 4th grade (10 y/o) I had some pretty deadbeat friends. Always whacking each other, and they were extremely stupid. I was the only smart one in the group. I was pretty innocent, I had never watched pornography, and didn't even know about masturbation. Friends on the other hand, well, they were pretty dirty-minded.  


So, I arrived at school one day, only to see they were kicking and slapping each other's asses, which looked just like one of their normal goofs involving hurting each other. I was pretty confused, and that's what I assumed.  


There was a girl I used to speak to, not much, but she was sort of a good friend. So when I was in class, I was having a good time with her, and I remembered the ""funny goof (it wasn't a funny goof)"", and that's where it happened. I slapped her ass. She was clearly very embarrassed and instantly reported me to the teacher, while I was standing around pretty confused. The teacher I had knew me very well, and knew I had no dirty intention. The teacher had a speak with me and explained it was inappropriate, and you can't do, especially to girls.  


The girl never spoke to me again, and I never got a chance to apologise to her, as I moved schools the next year. It's been around over 5 years now, but I still feel extremely guilty, and it haunts me whenever I talk to a female classmate.",2022-03-30 13:39:29

Back in grade 10 (sophomore year for Americans) I was sadly in science class with a guy who was mad that I dumped him after dating for a week in grade 8. His friends were also in the class and I tried to ignore them. I got partnered with them at our science desk because no one else in the class liked me lol. So I tried to get along with them but they just seemed to want to annoy me. I took most of them as jokes like they would hide my pen or book.

It became more and more extreme things until they covered my iPhone 6 (at the time it was the second latest phone. This is important) with play dough that we were meant to use for our activity in class. 
I laughed it off but was really annoyed because it took ages for me to clean the speakers out and they didn’t work well after that. 

Now for the actual issue. 
There was a three guys involved. We will just call them L, S and M
L was the salty guy I dated for a week
M was Ls best friend at the time
And S was just a quiet dude who just wanted friends 

One day I wanted to get my work done and just ignored them all. L and M did NOT like this. They constantly wanted to get my attention and were pestering me for half the lesson until they just stopped. 
I was thankful but then at the end of the class I realised my phone was gone. I laughed it off initially and told them to give it back. They both said “we don’t know where it is” 
I began to freak out and get annoyed and told them firmly to give my phone back. 
They told me they told S to hide it on the side tables of the class and I looked there but it wasn’t there. 
They both looked at S and he looked really worried. 
I started freaking out and asking them to stop playing and find my phone or I’m telling the teacher (I know I was that type of person).
The teacher had just come back from the storage room and noticed all 4 of us still there and asked what’s going on. I told him and he made all 3 clean the room but I objected and said S wouldn’t have done this if L and M hasn’t have told him to. The teacher let S off with a warning while L and M shot daggers at me as they were made to clean the classroom.

My phone was NOT found and I cried to my parents about it and they were obviously pissed. We were in no way well off and I paid for the phone with my own money that I got from working (it was $600). 

We spoke to the school but L and M convinced the principal that they just told S to hide it and they didn’t know he would lose it. The principal was not as forgiving as my teacher and blamed it all on S.
His parents were called and his parents, my parents and the vice principal had a meeting at the school. S was crying and I felt so bad because he did not deserve this as much as L and M did. 
The problem was that I really did need the money from him and even with my request to have the other boys pay for a third each, the father of S outright said no and said that his son needs to learn from his mistakes. 
My parents tried to comfort me when I said that I felt bad but I still feel bad to this day. 
L and M are absolute jerks and I have an even worse story to share about L and M threatening to SA me to the point that I didn’t feel safe going to school for a week. 
I honestly want to reach out to S even though we are 20 now and say that I feel bad but maybe it was such a small moment in his life. This may seem so petty and small in comparison to most of these posts but I am really pissed that the small guy got punished instead of the real assholes.",2022-03-30 05:28:54

One day my brother threw it off the bed and onto the carpet (it was fine) but I took it from him so he wouldn’t try it again. It was then I realised it probably needed to be clean again. Me trying to big the big 8 year old I wasn’t, I wanted cleaned it. But I didn’t clean it with a wipe like my dad usually did, no no no, my pea brained self I ran the iPad under the bathroom sink. And not just for a couple of seconds it was under there for a good minute. Once it was shiny and clean I dried it with a towel and began to use it. 

Horrifyingly, as I was watching stampy and squid the screen gained a whitish blueish spot, a spot that was quickly spreading. I think I was smart enough to realise that it was because I had ran it under water, and knowing this, my evil, conniving, 8 year old self ran to my dad and told him my brother did it. My brother believed he did because he remember earlier he through it on the ground. My dad gets mad at my brother, my brother is crying, and I come out the innocent party.

Now, I never told anyone about that, except my ex-girlfriend and she was pretty dismissive about the whole thing.

Since a didn't stole anything ou caused any real damage to her, I don't know if i should confess to her what I did or just follow my life, you know, guilt will fade eventually, I know that, so, what you people think ?

Just for you know, i could go to jail if i confess, and i don't feel like I really deserve that.

I was talking to my friend and I asked him if I should take one from the binder.

I also want to preface this by saying it was not a small business so I was not stealing from someone’s livelihood. 

A couple years back, I worked retail for a big technology company. When I say big, I’m talking about this company being worth billions. I’m sure you can figure out who it is. 

Anyone who has worked retail knows it’s rough but I have not ever experience retail rough like this. Their customers were some of the meanest, most entitled, crazy sons of bitches I have ever met. After a couple of years, I started to hit my limit with the clientele. My best friend who also worked there passed away, so that didn’t help my state of mind. If a customer was really rude to me, and also bought insurance on their devices, I would sneak a gift card to the bathroom and return their insurance on the gift card which I pocketed. This went on until I quit and I’m shocked I never got caught and arrested. 

I didn’t even need the money, I was just angry at the world and didn’t care what happened to me. Of course, now I realize, how stupid (and lucky) I was. I definitely feel guilty about it to this day and wish I never done it. Those customers might have been shitty that day, but they don’t deserve to have paid that much money for something and not be able to use it.

Edit: Someone in the comments made me realized just now that I’m stealing from only the customers this way and not the company. Yikes, I suck. 

My only optimistic thought is that Apple is known to be extremely catering to customers. If a customer did come to utilize their AppleCare, and we were able to pull up their receipt (easily, just scanning the phone) and see that they did indeed purchased it, it’s highly likely the person helping would think it was a misunderstanding and gotten an override for them. I know I would have. We were not paid enough to argue on behalf of the store and would much rather let the customer get what they want.

We look at him and go “what the fuck is this money” he was like “it’s change”. I replied “bro this is all of the money, there’s no way you stole it”. He says “yeah I did”. We both shake our heads and eat our chip and drink so quickly while nervously laughing as we didn’t know why he didn’t just fucking pay 😂. He had the money he easily could’ve paid but he didn’t.   Anyway we waited for lunch to end and just as we were leaving some security guards came into the caf but thankfully we just blended into the group and went home shortly after. We would ultimately go to a different college (all 3 of us) but it was still a very stupid move. Till this day I ask him why he did that and he says “because it was funny”. It is funny only because we didn’t get caught 😂",2022-03-21 16:16:39

I changed the K value on it to “•0 + 69” which basically made almost any equation equal to 69. I showed my friend this because I thought it was funny and every time we grabbed a calculator for class we would do this before we put it back so some kid’s calculator would only give the answer 69.  A few days later my friend and I ended up changing all of the calculators in our class to do that when the teacher was gone. Fast forward a week or two and the teacher had a talk with all the students about it and said if she found out who did it they would get suspended. She said she had a lot of people trying to find out who it was but nobody could. A few people suspected my friend but nobody had proof. We were never caught.,2022-03-20 20:17:29

Also, this roommate had clearly been living here for years without ever cleaning once. 

Anyway, I caught my partner cheating on me in our bed. It was near the end of the month, and my partner literally asked “Well do you still want to live together?” I left within the following days and moved out of state. 

Since it was nearly the first, I obviously was about to owe my roommate rent. I was and still am dirt broke, working in a chronically underpaid field (human services) and can’t even pay my $1250 a month student loan payment. 

She bragged multiple times about being an engineer manager at fitbit and making $200k a year. Not that it makes my actions justifiable, but it does make it hard to convince myself I should pay her. 

I left Boston and told her I’d send a check to the address. I didnt. 

This was years ago, and I think about it a lot. I’ve tried finding her on venmo or facebook, but she was going through a gender transition and must’ve changed her name. It’s not like I have the cash to pay her back but I was hoping to do a payment plan or something.

I'm younger than my sister by 14 years, she had her first son when I was 5 years old and her second son when I was 7. 

She lived with me and my parents for the majority of my childhood and so did my nephews. My parents were very neglectful and so was my sister. Taking care of my nephews was my job almost immediately.

When I was 12, I was forced to share a jack and jill style bathroom with them. They'd stay up all night screaming, yelling and jumping around. They would sneak into my room and steal my things and my parents didnt do anything about it.

It got to the point that was sleep deprived, juggling school, kids and my parents expectations. If they'd get to loud and wake me up, I'd threaten them. Eventually it lead to hitting.

At some point I realized what I was becoming and what I was doing and I tried to distance myself from them as much as I could, i know i hurt them and i did irreversible damage. 

I will never forgive myself for that. I dont expect them to ever forgive me either.

It happened again when I was 18. I had a full time job and my sister moved back in with us. 

I was trying to get my own apartment but all my money and time outside of work was spent taking care of kids that werent mine. 

I was expected to take care of them full time as well as take care of the house while my sister sat back and relaxed.

I snapped, I hit them when they talked back to me more than once. I know their mother did it too.

I took the first chance I had to move away and have stayed away since.

I've personally given them so much trauma when they needed me the most. I dont ever plan on having kids of my own, i cant trust myself to not repeat my mistakes.

I'm a monster. I hate that version of myself and I will regret harming them till the day I die. I love them so much and I hurt them so badly.

Im 32 now. The only person I've told about this is my husband. Hes tried to console me but I know I dont deserve it. I feel guilty for even letting him try to comfort me.



Update: it's been an emotional roller coaster but for those intrested, I reached out to them via email. (after consulting my therapist.) 
They accepted my apologies and things are good.

 We've been playing video games together in our spare time the past couple of days and I'm really enjoying the time I've spent with them. 

They have already gotten therapists and are refusing to let me pay for anything. I've set aside a portion of my savings for them so if they're ever in a bind, I can help them financially.

I will be helping the oldest welcome their little girl into the world in August and I couldnt be more excited.

I still dont plan on having children of my own, but I'm looking into going to school to become an elementary teacher. (my dream job.)

i think the reason why i stole so much was because no one suspected me, and perhaps i was a bit too resentful about never getting rewarded with anything. it might’ve been because i was a foreigner, as xenophobia is very common here. i’m not joking when i say i was a wonderful child, but i was never treated like the local children and i knew that.

i didn’t stop stealing after that, though. i eventually moved onto stealing in first through second grade by getting into my teachers desks right after school but before club time. i only stole stickers or stamps. eventually i started feeling bad about it, because my teacher used to reward me from time to time and i felt like it wasn’t fair to her. i wasn’t ignored like i had been in the past, so i stopped. i’m not proud of it, but i’m not ashamed of it either. it’s a bit sad if you think about it.",2022-03-17 18:30:39

We decided to break into their room through the window since the doors were locked and hide under the beds to scare them when they come in. In the process of hiding we saw sanitary pads in one of the girls suitcase that was sitting next to the bed and thought it would be funny to stick them on somewhere (this was the first time we saw something like this), so we glued one on the pillow and one on the wall and ran away.

When the girls came back they started screaming and told the teachers someone did it, but they told that someone put USED pads all over the bed and the floors and walls like there was a 100 of them. Of course this was not true, we only used two clean ones.

Naturally the teachers were pissed and they didn't let the class go to dinner until someone confesses, but we never did, someone else took the shot so we could all just go eat. The kid who took one for the team ended up being sent back home from the trip.

It is like a boba place where they also sell some food and dessert like items. I am a broke college student and I hate campus food so I typically buy food from there whenever I work since we do get employee discount. However I thought, why don’t I take this up a notch and get it for even cheaper. I started putting hella discount on my food items so I can just stock up with food in my dorm and just never have to buy food on campus again. They were a family owned business but I know they are and I am pretty sure they make a lot of money because of how many college students come everyday which is how I justified my actions at the time. Basically the students who worked there are in charge of making drinks while the kitchen staff is basically the family members who cook. I would buy around 30 dollars worth of food and put in 90% discount every time thinking I got away with it. I got caught and the manager pulled me aside and told me that they have known for a while about the discount thing and also asked me why. Ofc I had to confess that it was stupid of me to do so and it won’t happen again. They let me off the hook and said that this is a warning and next time I do this I would be fired so obviously I won’t be doing this again.

I commited a hit-and-run a few years ago when I was young and stupid,508,td0xy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/td0xy6/i_commited_a_hitandrun_a_few_years_ago_when_i_was/,31,1647153381.0,"Just to clarify, nobody was hurt in the incident and this occured in NSW, Australia. What happened was, I was in the angled street parking in front of a supermarket and was backing out to leave the parking space. I looked all around to check for pedestrians or other hazards, all was clear, so I looked over my shoulder out the back of the car towards the left, which was the direction I was backing. 

Unbeknownst to me, the vehicle to my right must have decided to back out at the exact same time as me. Their vehicle was a great big 4WD (SUV for any Americans reading this), fairly recent model too but not brand new or anything (made after 2015 as an estimate), so I'm guessing they may not have seen my car backing out at the same time as theirs. I was in my parents 1990s Ford Falcon, and the roof would possibly have been just below their side window if they even looked, but I would have thought that these newer cars have side sensors or the mirror would be big enough to enable them to see me? I don't know, but anyway. 

As I'm backing, about a third of the way out of the space I notice in my periferal that the 4WD is backing at the same time, so I stop. They sort of slowed, but continued backing up, so I thought hey, they've noticed me and are just gonna go around me, no problem. Wrong answer - I waited and watched in horror through my rearveiw mirrow as they scraped across the rear bumper of my parent's car. I didn't really feel anything to be honest but it looked like they were really close so I wasn't sure if they'd even hit me. But after they got out of their park they quickly pulled into another space not far up the street, presumably to check out the damage, and I seen a decent amount of green paint smeared across the white of the rear side portion of their car. 

In a panic (and already being half out of my space), I quickly left the scene down a sidestreet. I know full well that even if you haven't hurt somebody in an accident, you're still meant to exchange details and all that, but in my panicked state and after having a rough time at work so far that day, I just didn't want to deal with it so I left. 

I had only had my licence a few months and was 18 at the time, I think they may have seen my red P-Plates as I left the scene in a panic and with it being a cheap 1990s Ford sedan perhaps assumed I wouldn't have insurance (my parents did but I wasn't listed on it at the time, something I learned months after the incident). Or maybe because they realised I had stopped backing, they hit me and would be considered at fault so didn't bother with insurance, I'm not sure. There were other people around as this happened during my lunchbreak, but given that nothing has come of it I guess I'm off the hook from a legal/financial perspective. And the Falcon was fine, just a few little scratches on the corner of the bumper, most of which were fixed /covered with a bit of cut and polish and my parents never noticed it or said anything about it. 

I was really nervous for the following months, just waiting for the cops to show up at my door or to be handed a court order or something, none of that happened though. But I still feel really guilty about running away rather facing the consequences of my actions simply because I didn't want to deal with it.",2022-03-13 08:36:21

Toward the end of 7th grade, I suffered a very traumatizing experience that led me down the path of unethical behavior. My 7th grade science teacher was horrible. She derived such a sick thrill from yelling that, if I said the right thing, she would twist what I said into something that I did not say. My school had that stupid policy that said that you had to get all tests and quizzes signed by your parents, no matter what grade you got. In seventh grade, I got this science test back. We went over it in class. There were a few spelling errors that I had. I had to write each word that I misspelled 10 times. I corrected the spelling, but I forgot to get the test signed. I told my teacher “I corrected it, but I forgot to get it signed.” I said this in a very respectful tone. She said in a very condescending tone and even made sure to yell it  “NO, YOU CORRECTED IT WITH ME. DON’T ACT LIKE YOU DID WORK.” That reply made no sense. First of all, I meant that I corrected the spelling. Second of all, me saying that I corrected it does not mean that I didn’t correct it with her. If someone told you a story about how they went to Brazil and you replied by saying “No you went to South America,” that would make no sense, going to Brazil is going to South America. Similarly, my teacher’s response makes no sense, as me correcting it with her is correcting it. Only if I specifically said that I did not correct it with her could her response possibly make any sense. 

If I had forged my dad’s signature, I would not have been written up and my teacher would not have chewed me out like she did. Think about the message that that sends. As a Catholic school, they (my middle school teachers) are totally against academic dishonesty, but had I committed forgery (which is a form of academic dishonesty), everything would have been hunky dory. 

In the 8th grade, any time I forgot to get something signed, I forged my dad’s signature. 

In the 10th grade, I stayed after school one day, because I had practice for track. School got out at 2:15 and practice did not start until 3:00, so I had some time to kill in between the end of the last period and the start of practice. I walked by the classroom of my Social Studies teacher. The door had been left open. My social studies teacher had taken a personal day that day, I know because we had a substitute teacher. I entered the class, noticed that the answer key for a test was unattended, took it, shoved it into my backpack, took it home and used it to study. 

In the 11th grade, I had a test in social studies. I had a 504 plan ( [https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+504+plan+in+ct&rlz=1C5CHFA\_enUS959US960&oq=what+is+a+504+&aqs=chrome.1.0i512l2j69i57j0i512l7.5891j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+504+plan+in+ct&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=what+is+a+504+&aqs=chrome.1.0i512l2j69i57j0i512l7.5891j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) ) which stated that if I did not finish a test in the allotted time, I could have some extra time to get it done. I really took advantage of that, one might even say I abused it. After having completed the multiple choice section of the test, I purposely did not complete the essay section and I asked the teacher if I could finish the test after school. While I was supposed to be completing the test, I wrote down the essay questions on a piece of paper and stuck that piece of paper in my pocket. That way, I could study the answers to those questions in study hall. 

In the 12th grade, for English class, we had to read the Shining by Steven King and take quizzes based on the reading. We were allowed to use notes for the test. I went on Spark Notes, downloaded notes and printed them out. While we were taking the quiz, the teacher would walk around and look at us to see if we were cheating. He knew about the Spark Notes and he knew that some of us would use that as a means to cheat. The notes from Spark Notes were in bullet form. When I copied and pasted those notes, I edited them; paraphrasing the words slightly and switching from bullet form to paragraph form. That way, the teacher would believe that I typed my notes and did not simply download them. 

I was in undergrad when COVID hit. I was taking this class on Zoom. For that class, we would watch movies, engage in class discussions about the movies and then write papers about the movies. The teacher would call a break so that we could watch the movies during the break. I did not feel like watching the movie and I had other stuff to do, so I would just read the Wikipedia page about the movie and then engage in the discussion as if I actually watched the movie. The teacher actually believed that I watched the movie. One time, I actually waited until five minutes before class reconveened before I actually read the Wikipedia page, just to see if I could. That professor was known for being a tough but fair grader, I still got a B + in his class. 

My last semester of undergrad, I did an internship, as was required for my major. I had to complete 100 hours for my internship over the course of the semester and keep a time log. In order to meet the 100 hours, I would lie and say that I spent more hours than I actually did performing a particular task. Since my supervisors would never sign a time log containing a lie, I forged my supervisor’s signature. It would look suspicious to my supervisor if I never had a time log for her to sign, so I printed out two time logs, one for my supervisor to sign, and one on which I can forge my supervisor’s signature.",2022-03-10 04:08:26

I Bullied a Kid For Something He Couldn't Control 8 Years Ago,468,t9m19k,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/t9m19k/i_bullied_a_kid_for_something_he_couldnt_control/,60,1646760558.0,"I am 18 now.

When I moved to [REDACTED] around 9 years ago, I had escaped from a previous bullying situation and lots of drama and toxicity. Not to sound textbook here but I had a lot of baggage, enduring physical and emotional abuse for years, SA'ed before then, a lot of bullying from students and teachers. I had come to a clean slate. I had made friends, made a good impression, was one of ""the boys"". I felt in control of my situation finally and that's when things went wrong. There was this poor boy in my class, we'll call him 'Clay' (not his actual name). He only wore the same three outfits, he'd come to school covered in filth, smelled absolutely horrid, and he wasn't really bright at all. He's kind of like the classic ""Pigpen"" character.

Clay and I never really had any history, nothing he did that particularly pissed me off, he was just vulnerable and I was, to put it frankly, a shitty person. I picked up on the occasional teasing from the other kids and would occasionally yell out something insulting to him but it soon turned to my own solo act. I'd start teasing him, calling him ""Oscar the Grouch"", saying he lived in a trash can, calling him different insults based on his smell or his intelligence. It started off like this, and then it escalated. He ended up assaulting me in front of a teacher, and that's when it got worse. I lied about him ""bullying"" me or hitting me and he actually got in trouble without me having to elaborate or defend against him.

Soon enough I talked about Clay to everyone else, I tried to get the entire class to agree that they all hated Clay. I would go on rants about everything I hated about him. About how he was poor and stupid. It didn't help that he had an ""accident"" in class and then I drug that out. (To be fair though, other kids would talk about this incident way into highschool) (Also we were in 4-5th grade when this all happened). He didn't know how to ""defend"" himself so if I pushed him to a certain point, he'd either chase me or push me or hit me and I'd just laugh at him which only made him angrier.

Soon, Clay finally got the principal involved. Never had the pleasure of meeting his parents (to be honest, they probably didn't give a shit since they clearly neglected their son), but he and the principal sat me down and she basically told me he said I was bullying him. I flat out lied and said I had no clue what he was talking about, that he had assaulted me and it went no further. I didn't even have my parents involved. And honestly I hate that principal to this day for not doing anymore about the situation or at least trying to catch me in my lie.

Clay didn't deserve what I did to him. I feel disgusted with myself, and I don't think I'll ever be able to make amends to Clay because he dropped out of school in 6th grade. I feel like this became the reason everyone started to bully me so heavily in middle and highschool. It's just forever going to live on my conscience that I bullied a kid, tormented Clay for things out of his control and made him so mad he resorted to crying and violence.

I knew what I did was wrong when I did it, I knew it was even worse later in middleschool. I want to be able to go back and make amends because I may have changed and I may be completely against what I did but I tormented and possibly traumatized someone. Not asking for advice if it's ""How to make amends"" because I have no clue where Clay is. But I'm getting this off my chest finally.

Edit; I AM leaving Clay alone. I do not know anything about his whereabouts. The last time I saw him was 6 years ago as he was dropping out of school and I don't even remember his actual name or last name. Pretty sure no one else remembers him either. It's haunted me, how I treated him, how tragic his life was, how bullying is ignored where I live, but I'm not going to pity myself or whine about it. It's just something I've never told anyone. Not even my closest friends. Not even my best friend that I love with all of my heart knows about this. If I did know who and where Clay was, I still would leave him alone. Maybe I'd get him a gift but I don't want to remind him of what I put him through.",2022-03-08 19:29:18

I trespassed in someone’s hiking trail that lead to a big lake,850,t85dis,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/t85dis/i_trespassed_in_someones_hiking_trail_that_lead/,95,1646592347.0,"This was pretty recent, like 5 months ago. One day I decided to walk one of the trails that was up the driveway to my house, the trail was a 20 minute walk and It’s pretty cool and had a creek. After walking for a bit I found a split path and the right path had a “No Trespassing” sign but didn’t have a name signed at the bottom where the owner signs it, I thought for a bit but decided to take the left path and didn’t think much about it.

A few weeks later I thought about that  “No Trespassing” sign, I was determined to trespass and see what’s ahead on the trail because I love exploring the outdoors. But I wanted to trespass with a friend and not by myself, so my step-moms oldest son came over and we decided to go back to the trail.

We found the sign while walking and decided to find out what’s up ahead, there wasn’t much but after 5 minutes we find this lake and we can see the road. There was chairs next to the lake and even a wooden boat, there was another path to the left and we decided to follow it. There was also some metal cylinder structure and some small building with a locked door near the lake.

We were now walking through this cool bamboo forest and then we found the end of the trail and decided to turn back and walk home. Another week later my step moms oldest brother’s girlfriend came over and we decided to walk back and trespass again, but this time the bamboo forest was cut down for some reason.

It was a very cool trail but I don’t think I should’ve trespassed, let alone twice.",2022-03-06 20:45:47

I still haven’t told ANYONE and I need to get it off my chest, it’s especially weighing on me since he died recently.

At the time, I was dating a really shitty guy who I was convinced was just having a rough patch in life. Even when he started stealing money from me that year, I let it go after a small fight. He’d leave me with very little, and I was often going to my dad’s place for snacks. 

One day though, I reached my limit. I had gotten a bonus from my job at the time and I had no plans of telling my boyfriend about it, in hopes that I could finally have money for myself. But he found out, and inevitably stole it. I did start a big fight between us, and ran to my dad’s that night to sleep over.

I explained everything to him, and he was very supportive. I even had to talk him down when he started threatening to go attack my boyfriend himself. We ate dinner, and he went to bed a little later. So, I was alone with my thoughts. I remembered that my dad had been saving money to go on vacation, after several decades of hard work. My dad wasn’t very well-off himself, so the $300 he had saved so far was a big deal. 

But, something came over me. I stole all the money from the glass jar he had been keeping it in and then broke the jar, with a plan. I also broke a few little trinkets that were laying around. 

When my dad woke up the next morning, he saw the broken empty jar and demanded an explanation, as I had been standing there. I forced myself to cry (although it wasn’t hard) and made up the story that my boyfriend had just come in, started a huge fight, and stolen the money, breaking other things in the process. 

He didn’t even question me, I guess my crying worked. He immediately went to call the cops, but I begged and convinced him not to, saying stuff like “he pays the bills in our apartment, I’ll have nothing if he gets arrested.” And other bs. It took a lot to convince him not to report it, he offered me to stay at his place, but I kept making excuses. 

After a few days I went home, feeling sick with myself. I wanted so badly to return the money, but I felt like he would have never forgiven me. Looking back, I wish I could punch myself in the face for that. 

I was such a blind idiot, and he continued to be a supportive dad after that, even though I stayed with that monster of an ex for 2 more years. But last year, my current boyfriend and I went in on a Christmas present for my dad, it was an all-expense paid trip to go on the vacation he dreamed of. It was a LOT for us to pull off, but I still feel like I haven’t redeemed myself for what I did to him before. I also haven’t told my boyfriend about this, I just told him that I wanted to surprise my dad with this trip and continued the lie I had been committed to.",2022-03-06 18:37:19

So, backstory

I am a 6'1"" 165 lbs 14 year old, and this kid is like 90-100 lbs 13 year old, so obviously no fight would be a fair fight. This kid was very high functioning but a little autistic, but I consider him to not be impaired at all.

So this kid, I'll call him Rodger, has an inexplicable hate for me. I believe it's because I accidentally tripped him on one of the first few days we knew each other. He hated my guts beyond your imagination because I wouldn't feed into his attempted bullying. He knocked over my drink 2 days in a row, and I just didn't say anything because 'oh it's probably an accident or his special needs'.

The third day in a row, I knew it was no accident. So I brought some good double-sided tape and taped it down. He hit it as expected, and it didn't fall over. He was mad now, so he potted his revenge. Every time he saw me he tried to trip me and even lied to my friends about me, nearly ruining my relationship with my gf, and almost got me in trouble for harassment but everyone said he was lying.

The worst thing he did, was he managed to steal my phone while it was on, ran into the women's bathroom, and was about 2 clicks from sending literal hardcore porn to my mother. At this point I had enough, so I contacted the principle and he just told me, and I quote, ""He's special needs, we legally cannot do anything to him, even if he did what you claim he did.""

So I formed a plan. He had mentioned wanting to fight a few times (he thought he could just punch me in the balls), so I shoved him in the hallway to make him ask for a fight.

As expected, he said, ""Do you want to fight you little prick? I swear your balls will regret it""  
I responded with ""Sure, lets go out to the field we can settle this right now.""

I don't think he expected me to say yes, but was too prideful to back down. So now, with no people watching, we squared up and as expected I absolutely destroyed him. I pushed him to the ground, kneeled on his chest while scratching his arms with my inhumanly long finger nails, then picked him up over my head and did a rep with him, before dropping him 6 feet down onto the grass. I then proceeded to step on his chest, tell him that if anyone hears of this then death will be too good for him, and I walked away.

I would do it again, but it's nice to get off of my chest.",2022-03-04 08:29:02

One day, While putting back the heavy instrument everyone was out the room, I had turned my bag around to be on my chest instead of my back, and I looked at his desk that was in the very back of the room. 

And on his desk was the Camera, I grabbed it as soon as i saw it. I bagged it and left, passing my teacher in the hallway, We made eye contact and all I did was wave, Walking past him swiftly. 

About a week later he had finally noticed. One day walking into the class , He had a picture of it on the board, And people were looking around for it. Suddenly he goes “I know who took it, If no one brings it back by next class Im contacting authorities.” Now, 11 Year old me was scared shitless. The next class I dropped it on his computer, And never told him. 

What did I record? Shitty minecraft gameplays. Pointed the camera at the monitor, And made the worst quality videos ever. 

But, To this day I have never told anyone.",2022-03-03 15:28:55

Very little damage, it got a little scrunched up and stripped the paint from that sharp point. Made a fucking loud bang though. Very embarrassing.

And so, one day I got it in my head to get to school early and steal a few boxes of the chocolate. Then I sold it at the school and kept the cash. Since I wasn't on the sellers list no one ever actually expected me to turn in any profits and since no one really checked with anyone until it was all over I got away with it.

I’ve had this friend who Ive known and has stuck by my side since we were in kindergarten let’s call her Trisha. We are well past high school graduation and still to this day she’s always there for me and I for her. It makes me feel kinda shitty because back when we were in high school we were in this kind of friend group. It was mainly just me and one of my other best friends at the time. 

The problem is the other friend of mine was kind of rude let’s call him Nate. Nate was a bully to say the least. He was always making mean jokes about peoples insecurities but that’s just how he was and if you didn’t like it you didn’t have to be friends with him. I liked being friends with him but I HATED when he would joke around about the things I’m insecure about. But if you tried to tell him that his joke wasn’t funny he called you sensitive and usually anyone else in the group would get on your case as well. 

When Trisha wanted to start hanging out with me and Nate I wasn’t so sure because of how he is but they already were acquainted so I hesitantly agreed. Well he obviously started bullying her about things that were out of her control (her hair, appearance, forehead, etc) He would always criticize her hair t most and would mock her when she talked by saying “ooga booga” (she’s black and he’s not so it’s kind of racist) I obviously felt bad but I was glad he was making fun of someone other than me so I would join in on the bullying. I didn’t see it as racist or bullying at the time, I was young and just wanted to fit in. Now that I’m older I feel horrible and I just want to apologize but she seems to have moved past it and is on her own journey of self love. 

We keep in contact now and always make sure we’re ok and will constantly check in one one another. She is my best friend still to this day and it makes me feel so bad knowing what I did to her",2022-02-27 15:43:45

Not sure if this violates rule 7, its not specifically about politics, there is a political sign involved but thats the first 2 lines of the story. 

Just before the 2020 election a sign went up near my house. I don't recall everything it said but the last line was something like ""Socialism is slavery, Republicans are our last hope"". It was on a vacant lot so i'm pretty sure the owners of the land didn't approve it. Regardless, i didn't want something like that in my neighborhood. So i did something about it. In the middle of the night i snuck out of the house, dressed in all black, face mask, gloves, the works. The street was quiet but if a car did drive by i would duck into the tall grass. It would be hard to see me even if you were actively looking for me. I got up to the sign and using a knife, freed it from its poles (it was attached via bungee coords). I took it with me, partially as a prize and also to prevent them from just reattaching it. I was halfway home when i saw headlights coming up over the hill. Now idk if it would be a police car or not, regardless i look suspicios af, so i jumped into a ditch. Now it had been raining all day so the grass was wet but i didn't realize how slippery it was. My foot slipped and i heard a snapping sound and the worst pain of my life. Here i was, probably a broken ankle in a ditch in the middle of the night, dressed in all black after commiting a crime. I didn't have my phone on me as i was worried about my location data being used against me, so i had no way to call someone. I left the sign behind as there was no way i could get up holding it and getting down to pick it up again wasn't gonna happen with my ankle. In extreme pain i limped the half mile back home, it took a half hour. Every step was excuriating. I went to the ER that night and found i had broke my fibula near my ankle. I had surgery to put a plate and pins in. I couldn't walk for 3 months. Yes it was stupid, i probably deserved it, but i would say it was worth it. They never replaced the sign.",2022-02-24 18:33:54

After I had unloaded this unholy shit I had then noticed my stall was out of TP. I also notice that the guy in the stall beside me just so happened to have his shorts all the way off(my thought as a kid was that he should have just kept his shorts on like a normal person instead of just leaving them on the ground). So I then proceeded to do what I thought my only option was, and that was to use his pair of shorts to wipe my ass. The entire time he was repeatedly screaming “GIVE ME MY SHORTS BACK!!” and I’m almost positive that in that moment he had no clue what my intentions were and just wanted his shorts back so he could go back to class, or maybe he had thought that I was stealing from him. Regardless after I had finished absolutely ruining his shorts I had to find an escape route, meanwhile this kid is still screaming at me to give his shorts back. My only option was to set them out of his reach and sprint out of the bathroom in hopes he wouldnt be able to catch up to me.

I had noticed that some of my coworkers were just taking some drinks from the cooler we had in the front of the store and I was curious if we were allowed to just take a drink whenever we wanted… we weren’t but I didn’t care because it meant less money in the pockets of the owner. Little by little each shift I was stealing after that, I started off with just taking a drink during some of my shifts and giving away small things like sauce cups to people who asked. Eventually I started making my own pizzas and taking them after my shifts without paying for them. One day my manager had brought to the workers attention that we could not take food or drinks without paying for them. I didn’t care though because all the workers myself included were taking abuse from not only the owner of the store but also from the customers we would get. Eventually I started taking multiple pizzas drinks sauces literally anything I felt like taking and even my friends would come in when I was working and I would just give them anything they wanted.

I’ve had access to said stash ever since they left. About a year ago I lost my job and was and have been struggling to find new work in my area that pays enough to keep my bills in order. I got a little desperate and took what I needed from their pile to make ends meet. To make a long story short I kept going back as the temptation was too hard to resist. The money was spent on mostly rent, food, random expenses (dentist, vet bills) and occasionally fun things like a new video game. For the most part just living. 

It’s been a year now and I’ve taken a noticeable amount and am starting to really feel the guilt and weight of my actions. My parents collectively make about 300K yearly and have been doing so for some time now, so they aren’t stretched for cash. It was essentially an emergency fund I’ve been exploiting. But now I worry that when they inevitably discover that their money is gone they’ll press charges and send me to prison. I’m newly wed and don’t think I could give up my spouse and go to jail. The thought depresses me to the point where I think I’d rather commit suicide. I genuinely don’t know how my parents will react when they find out what I’ve done. It terrifies me. 

I love my parents very much and the thought of this being brought to light breaks my heart. There is a good chance that they won’t find out for another year or two at most. Part of me wants to enjoy what time I have left of them being oblivious and the other part wants me to get it over with and confess what I’ve done. Overall I feel super shitty but now there is no way I can repay them at this point. Most money I’ve made in my life is $18/hr and that barley paid my cost of living let alone pay back a debt like this. I have stopped taking from the stash and I am applying like crazy to get a new job before what little cash I still have runs out. I already know I’m a shitty person, but it does feel slightly better to talk about this finally. Thanks for listening.",2022-02-22 12:28:22

I tried so hard to get her password because I desperately wanted to delete her entire history assignment before she had a chance to email it to the teacher. Reading this back it sounds so much worse than it did in my head. In the end, I didn't get her password in time and she handed her assignment in and passed, neither of us got dux and we're still friends, she hasn't changed a bit and still never does her homework but neither do I anymore so I've stopped comparing myself to her and it's heaps better.

Another brilliant plan of mine was to bring the hamster to the target across the street, rob target as well, and empty andrews lego box into my backpack then put the hamster in the box and sneak it in. It worked and my mom picked us up. She had to stop at costco so we spent a good 15 minutes blasting music and playing with the poor thing.

What frustrated me was the fact that she didn’t eat it but was just showing it off. So I stole it.

It became a whole issue, she told the teacher and they started looking for the culprit. I hid it in my clothes so they wouldn’t find it in my bag. Apparently that piece of candy was that important.

What I regret now that I’m older and look back on is the lack of empathy I had. The girl cried that day and never had the same queen like attitude from before. Yet, at that time I felt justified. I felt I had the right to rectify her behaviour.

Later that night we all went out, we decided not to do it in our neighborhood because we thought people would know it was our group of friends. As we were walking we saw this convertible with the top down and I said “this top is down let’s spray a bunch of silly string in it” so we sprayed a bunch of silly string in this guys car and I mean we basically went through each of our cans. After we were done being menaces we had to walk past the same car we silly stringed and the owner was out there and he was pissed, he was holding a crowbar and pacing back and forth.

Now that I am in 9th I realized how fu\*ked this story is. Getting back to the story, after a long day in the class we had free time to do whatever we wanted to on our laptops until our parents picked us up. At the time because the class was full of 5th and 6th graders, we obviously played Roblox or Minecraft because it was the only thing our crappy laptops could run. Though we could bring our own laptops, the school provided laptops to kids who didn’t or could not, and because of this, most people would usually sign out of their Roblox accounts before leaving class. Though for the unlucky kid who I am writing this about, he did not. So after leaving class I found this kids laptop and noticed that he had around 3000+ Robux, and at the time games like meep city were becoming quite popular, so my dumbass decided it’d be an amazing idea to spend all the poor kids’ money on meep city, now 4-5 years later I feel like a complete douchebag for that.

I graduated at the top of my class by stealing smart students’ homework,1090,suvwxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/suvwxw/i_graduated_at_the_top_of_my_class_by_stealing/,110,1645123086.0,"I was definitely smart in school. I was the type of student where I could take an exam and score and A without any time spent studying. But when it came to homework, I would do anything to avoid it, and I figured out a creative way to get myself through all of my tough classes without any critical thinking. The way my high school worked was everyone in the school had a google account that all of your assignments were supposed to be turned in through. The username had the same criteria for everyone: first two letters of your first name, last four of your last name, and your graduating year. The password was your student ID number followed by the school district. Once I realized that I could easily figure out my classmates ID numbers without suspicion, life was a breeze. I’d make friends with a smart kid, pull out my student ID card and make fun of my photo on it. Then I’d ask to see what theirs looked like and sneakily take a picture to remember their number. Other kids would have their card hooked to their backpack or they’d have to take it out to buy lunch in the cafeteria and I’d take photos of it that way. I had about 10 of my most hardworking peers accounts saved on my computer and all of their final work was my rough draft. I’d jazz it up to add my own personal flair, and change it a decent amount to the point where it was nearly impossible for a teacher to notice a similarity between our assignments and often turn it in to get a better grade than what they did. I ended up ranking top 15 of my class, was in the National Honors Society and won awards in a few of my classes. I’ve never told anyone before and I’m definitely not proud of it but I’m not sure that I would’ve graduated otherwise.

I thought this was a slight against me personally, and I'd always do shitty things like tell her I was my dad, give her food she didn't like and say it was a food that she did like, and wait until the very last minute if she needed help going to the bathroom, shower or eating.

I did this all in front of my little brother who I thought was oblivious at the time. I snorted the line and it hurt like hell it was probably only 65% actual cocaine and it was not worth it I was so desperate for a line at the time it didn’t matter.

Back then the menu was simple, and most people ordered the combos. We had a price chart and calculator beside the drive through register to help with the total. We’d tell the customer their total, then ring up a small coke or coffee to open the till, make change, and leave the extra in the box. When I pulled the register, I would take out the exact amount of what the report said it should have, then keep the extra that we had scammed. We didn’t mess with every order, so it just looked like a slow night. On a busy Saturday night, I could bring home around $400, sometimes more, even after splitting with my co-conspirators.

Two kids from each eighth grade class were picked. Other middle schools were included in this as well (A lot I think. There were a lot of eighth graders there). Anyway, the trip ended up being at high school that was like 40 minutes away. When we got there, there was 12th graders who greeted us. Each 12th grader had a list of five or six students that would be in there group. Once we were all separated and brought to empty classrooms, we were told that we had to come up with a two minute song about being a leader and how to inspire our fellow youths.

The 12th grader in charge of our group decided we were gonna rap and be the best of all the performing groups. We came up with lyrics and rhymes and I was mortified during this entire thing. Every time someone came up with some lame rhyme I was so anxious and terrified that I had to be a part of this group to perform this to the entire 12th grade. We finished, each of us got our three or four lines. Our rap was gonna start with us putting all our hands in a circle and screaming ""GO! GO! GO!"" then we were to spin around to face all the seniors and dance and jump around with microphones and rap about studying and being inspirational and shit. After we finished writing this rap we were all called down to the gym. Our leader got our sticker and we were the 10th of 12 groups to perform.

Each group went and I was clutching myself and humming to myself as the second hand embarrassment washed over me as every group got up and I had to watch 50 other middle schoolers horribly sing songs while all the seniors laughed and recorded us. Our group was near the rear entrance to the gym and there was a fire alarm maybe five feet outside the doors. I looked at it when we first walked down the hallway to the gym and thought for a second about how I wanted to pull this thing to get the fuck out of there. I was thinking about how I just wanted to die and how stupid and embarrassing this whole thing would be.

I had no business even being picked to go on this thing. I was a C/D level student who failed like 70% of the tests I took that year. The ones I did pass, I barely did. B's were scarce and A's were once in a blue moon and a TOTAL shock when they happened. I was this loner kid who was bullied a lot and always at the office and I absolutely 100% believe I was picked to go on this trip out of pity by my core teacher. I was so confused when I was picked to go on this trip, so was a kid in my class who screamed at my teacher about how ""I didn't deserve to go on this trip"" and that ""My name was always written on the board because I failed tests so often"".

I was standing at the back of my group while the 9th group performed. I slowly walked backwards, put my hand on the alarm, closed my eyes and pulled it and immediately jumped forward and pretended to be as shocked as everyone else. We then had to exit out of the gym through the main doors. By the time everything was cleared, our trip was over and we had to leave. My grade 12 group leaders were pissed and so was everyone else in my group. I was never asked if I pulled it or accused. I was so happy to get the fuck out of there.

"When I was a child, I stole food from the school's kitchen and nearby stores.",71,smwbnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/smwbnh/when_i_was_a_child_i_stole_food_from_the_schools/,19,1644256550.0,"Just an FYI upfront: I am in Canada. Canadian schools do not feed kids, ever. No lunch programs or anything of the sort here. So if your parents cannot feed you, then too bad, sucks to be you, no one is going to give you squat or otherwise lift a finger to help you.

For the sake of some more context, too, my parents divorced when I was five. Mother took me and we were living in a tiny, run down basement apartment with no windows. As fate would have it though, at around that exact same time, my Mother became very sick and was diagnosed with a very serious illness. The details are not important, but the fact of the matter is that she was utterly incapable of caring for me most of the time, and no friends or family who did live nearby stepped in to help.

Anyway. To be fair, Mother did pack me lunches.

The problem was, they were filled with rotten, disgusting food that actually made me physically sick. Bare slices of bread streaked with green mold. Bits of cheese with blue polka dots. Yogurt cups that smelled horrible and were full of bits of black mold. Strawberries with fuzzy white jackets.

Despite lacking a cafeteria where students could actually get food, schools usually did have a small kitchen with some food (for what purpose exactly I am not sure).

Out of desperation for something to eat that was not completely putrid, and especially since I usually did not have breakfast, I would sneak into the school kitchen regularly and snatch whatever I could hide in my pocket or under a sweater or something. Crackers, bread, maybe an apple or banana if I was lucky.

Failing that, if I could avoid detection and sneak off school property, there were a few stores nearby where I would go to often to steal whatever I could carry without being too obvious.

I became an absolutely masterful little thief.

Yes, I know it was wrong to steal. I knew that just as well then, too. I did not particularly want to do it, and I never enjoyed it. I did it out of sheer desperation. I never meant any harm to anyone - though I did know I was not only seriously breaking school rules, but the actual law as well. I knew it was wrong and I knew I would have gotten into very serious trouble for what I was doing, so therefore I was careful not to get caught.

I suppose I could have asked someone, anyone, for help - but I sort of did that once. I told my teacher exactly why I did not want the contents of my lunch bag. Her response was to go straight to Mother, who fiercely berated me for what I said, slapped me in the mouth and ordered me to never say any such thing ever again.

So, I did not. I just took things into my own hands.",2022-02-07 19:55:50

for our entire existence up to that point, we had got 5$ a week for allowance. then, our friends parents devised this graph thingy where on one side it had the days of the week and on the other side it had various chores and how much money they're worth. because of this, our friends earned WAY more allowance and greedy little 7 y/o me was jealous so i told my brother and we begged our parents to use that same graph. 

they agreed. so we used that for a few weeks, and all was well. i always did the same things every week so i had money i could rely on and my brother picked up on it and did the same. 

eventually, my parents wanted a break from us and they went on a two week vacation. during this, our grandpa babysat us. so he would make off the chores we did over the two weeks. but he had a weird way of marking things on the graph. instead of putting a check mark on the chores we did do, he put an X over the stuff we didn't do and left the things we did do blank. when our parents got back, they went over the sheets and assumed that the stuff he X'ed was the stuff we did do. so for each week we got 42.50$. we watched them do the math and neither of us dared correct them. we both wanted the payday.

When I was 12 my best friend and I would take the school calculators (usually around $100 a piece) and destroy them. Usually we would put the screen under our chair and stomp the chair as hard as we could until the calculator was unusable. We found a book shelf that was screwed into the wall that had about an inch and a half of empty space behind it. After breaking one, we would throw it behind the book shelf and it would never be seen again. We probably broke somewhere around 40 of them. My teacher had a suspicion that someone was stealing and selling them but in reality we were just breaking them.

We would also shove anything we could into electric pencil sharpeners so they would break.

We would find books and just rip them in half whenever nobody was looking.

We would pull the screws out of chairs so that when people sat on them they would break.

We would fill drains in the science labs with pencils and garbage to clog the drains.

I know we did a lot more but I can’t even think of all the stuff we did. We never once got caught. What’s worse, all the teachers saw us as star students and loved us. They never knew the torment we were behind. 

Something seemed to give us an adrenaline rush when we did it. It seemed so funny at the time and the memories are hilarious when I talk about it with my friend. Did anyone else go through a phaze where breaking things seemed like so much fun?",2022-02-07 02:04:14

I recently have done a lot of shadow-work/healing work on my distortions which have lead to a lot of karmic influences in my life, I believe. It started in college, I had just recently lost my virginity & had a lot of repressed sexual energy that occurred because of early childhood micro-traumas (as I recount this, I would like to make it clear, I'm not excusing my actions; I've done a lot of work to forgive myself for violating people like that, I have also started reaching out to those involved that I can get in contact w/ to actually start applying my healing to my life). Not exactly sure how it began, just started going into the bathrooms, in the showers, just to see if I could. I'm not sure how inconsequential the number of guys is, it wasn't very many, not lessening the wrongdoing in anyway. That happened til late into my freshman year mid-2017, then stopped due to housing/location changes, til late 2018, when I had already moved back home & started a new job. From there, that lasted ~3 months, til I moved depts. After that, there wasn't another incident til 2021, when I started my most recent job, only recently ending in early Dec. So, now we've reach the present moment & I am committed to telling the truth to those who weren't just passing strangers but had an impact on my life, no matter how small or big. I also have taken away something from this, it's given me empathy for a lot of people who are acting unconsciously due to lingering trauma, tho I can only speak on my realm of consciousness.

I started attending a new school in upstate New York in the fall of 1979 as a third grader.  To say I was unpopular ... would have been accurate.  In gym class, everyone quickly realized that I had never learned the fundamental rules of any sport.  Nor was I particularly athletic.  It wasn't a ""living hell"" - I had some friends.  But I was nowhere near the top echelons among my peers.

Students with severe mental disabilities were in a single class referred to as ""Special Ed.""  At the time, I knew nothing about Down Syndrome, or any of the other conditions that these students suffered.  All I knew was that somehow, they ranked even lower than me on the social totem pole.

I remember being in the schoolyard in fifth grade.  That would have been around 1981; I was about ten years old.  The special ed students stayed together as a group.  In part because other students (occasionally including me) would taunt them with epithets like ""retard"" which was not considered as taboo a word at the time.

Eventually a teacher pulled me aside.  He didn't yell at me as I deserved.  Perhaps he was tired/apathetic and doing the minimum.  Perhaps he recognized the fucked-up social-strata logic that I was following.  He knew that I didn't have much of a disciplinary record.  He basically told me in no uncertain terms to knock it off, and let the matter drop.

I stopped.  I had no further interactions with the special ed students.  But to this day, knowing that I participated in such cruelty to people suffering from what would be a lifetime social disadvantage bothers me.  Especially given how familiar I was with being on the receiving end of bullying for so long.",2022-02-03 21:02:07

I used to steal from my dad every weekend and let my brother take the blame for it,91,sh9vyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/sh9vyr/i_used_to_steal_from_my_dad_every_weekend_and_let/,5,1643657646.0,"When I was a kid, my dad used to roll all of his cigarettes by hand. Because of this, he would always have a stash of large tubs of tobacco and boxes of cigarette filters, and he kept it all together in a cabinet in our kitchen. 

When I was a freshman in high school, I thought it would be cool if I rolled myself some cigarettes and took them to school to smoke with my friends (it wasn’t). Because I was always the first one home after school/work, I immediately reached for the necessary items in the rolly-cabinet and set myself up. However, when I opened one of the canisters of tobacco I realized it wasn’t tobacco - it was around an ounce of weed. Score! I didn’t even know my dad smoked weed because he was still in the military at this time! I grabbed a Ziploc bag and took as much as I could without thinking it would be noticeable. To the inexperienced, it didn’t seem like enough to notice. Looking back now, I know I was probably stealing anywhere from 2-4gs each time. Not a large amount but definitely noticeable, particularly to someone who scales out their stash each time they take from it. 

I should add that I was somewhat of the “golden child” in my family. My older brother had just graduated high school and was heavily addicted to drugs at this point and always did poorly in school, still lived at home, while I was the polar opposite. I played on sports teams for my school, academic achievement awards, competed my sport on a national level, never really been in trouble with my parents or school. 

So when my dad finally confronted us (my brother) about the missing weed, we both vehemently denied any involvement. It’s also worth noting that he only confronted us when my mom wasn’t home. My dad was the more chill parent vs. my mom who was very strict and also untreated bipolar at this time.

Because I had a much better reputation with my parents, my brother took the brunt of the blame. Well, all good things come to an end right? One weekend in Sophomore year there was a party as per usual, so when no one was home I stocked myself up on weed and got an older friend to buy me liquor. I asked my dad to drive me to my friends house for a sleepover (so we could go together to the party), and on the way there he lights up a smoke. Except it doesn’t smell like a normal cigarette. In fact it doesn’t smell like a cigarette at all. So I glanced from the corner of my eye and realized it was, in fact, a joint, and pretended not to notice, just kept scrolling on my phone. To my surprise, and without saying a word, he reached his arm out to me to pass the joint. I wasn’t sure if this was a trap to get me in trouble or what he was doing, but I knew my mom was very explicitly against smoking weed so I figured she also didn’t know that he had it. I took the joint and puffed a couple times, inhaled and passed it back to him without coughing. He just smirked at me and said “that wasn’t your first time was it?” I just chuckled and said maybe. 

At this point, he confronted me about the missing weed. My brother was gone for the weekend and since my dad knew I was having a sleepover that night, he weighed his stash before leaving for work that morning. When I asked him to drive me, he weighed it again and noticed some missing. Since my brother was gone and my mom didn’t know, it was clear who was at fault here. He told me it was fine if I wanted to smoke up at parties with my friends as he’d much rather me smoking at parties than drinking, but just asked me to stop taking so much from him every week. 

Apparently it was costing him quite a bit to stay stocked up and he was hiding it from my mom at the same time, so spending frivolously on something he was also hiding was getting increasingly difficult. As a corporal in the military, he wasn’t making an overly abundant amount of money. He also told me let him know privately if I’ve got weekend plans and he’d hook me up with enough for ME, and my friends were on their own. Fair enough! We agreed on this and finished the joint together, he pulled up in my friend’s driveway and before I got out he put his hand on my shoulder and said “hey, let’s keep this between you and I alright?” And I always have. Until right now of course. 

Even after my mom started smoking weed too, I never told her. But maybe one day I will, now she would probably find it hilarious.",2022-01-31 21:34:06

I started stealing money from my mom to be able to afford chocolate. It was a great stress reliever at the time and it was a good thing to spend the money on because i could just eat the evidence.

My mom would ask me if I had stolen money from her a lot and I always said no and she believed me because I wasn't a known liar at the time. I stopped stealing money from her because once I was placed in an inpatient program it was impossible to do so. I haven't stolen money since I was about 16.

Some of the things I say when I troll on the internet is; “you will not replace us!” “whose streets? our streets!” “George soros is funding black lives matter to kill the white man” “muslims are destroying europe and their values are incompatible”

just extremely bigoted but it gives me a rush to say it and distracts me from the pain I feel in my life. and people get so mad when I say that so it’s hilarious and I can’t stop.",2022-01-31 10:46:45

I would go in there from time to time and just take a 20 when I was like elementary school age. If I was feeling frisky and he had just gotten a lot of cash, I would take two 20s. I just felt like it was okay since I didn't do it very often. Also he was a big drinker so I think that's why I could get away with it (he didn't even notice).

February of 2020, I was in grade 12 at the time and I have played hockey my whole life so naturally, I was on the high school (girls) hockey team for all four years of high school.

This was the final tournament so it was a pretty big one... we won the tournament, and in the dressing room after the coach gave out a speech and thanked me for my time as it was the last game I would ever play with the school team.

Being in grade 12, I had my car and I drove there so I did not require a bus ride home with the team. After the game ended and the coaches left the room, we all took pictures with the banner and when everyone was done taking pictures they gave it to me and I just stuffed it in my hockey bag and left. 

I brought it home and hung it up in my room, my plan was to keep it until one of the coaches realized they just didn't have it lol... well long story short in march coronavirus hit and I never returned back to high school. The banner has been hanging in my room ever since, I have asked my younger friends if the coaches ever noticed that they never had that banner and I don't think they ever noticed.

Now I just have a high school banner chilling in my room.

The year before this, when I was in grade 11, we won another tournament and won a trophy, I brought home the trophy and had a party that night and my friends and I took shots out of it. I returned the trophy that following Monday but I wonder if I just never brought the trophy back if I also could have kept that.",2022-01-28 21:16:06

One kid in the cabin proceeded to play with the light switch when the oldest kid left. He made sure to keep it down though when he stoped.A couple hours later I find myself alone in my cabin and of course I find myself playing with the light switch to see if the light could turn on whilst broken. 

The oldest kid bought a new bulb and before he attached it , he asked if we messed with the light switch, we said no. He then forgot to check the switch and went to replace the bulb. Somehow this dude gets severely electrocuted and then spends 4 days in the hospital. 

All the kids including me were pretty much interrogated. In the end we all blamed the kid who messed with it when the oldest kid left, even me. The sad part is that the entire time the falsely accused kid kept saying that it wasn’t him and that it was someone else. No one believed him except for me.

Fast forward to the next year it was one of my friends bday, and guess what’s there the kid, and it was one of the worst experiences  s I’ve had with a kid my age. What he did was invade one and my fronds personal space, we weren’t so mad with that but then he tried to fight one of us.

I also work full time and sometimes (usually a few days a week) I smoke in my car and then drive home which is about a 25 minute drive.

When I’m driving high I usually don’t have any issues and I’m still able to drive normally, but I’m aware that driving high can be dangerous and I do feel bad for possibly putting others in danger

Immediate regret washed over me as soon as I realized his nose was bleeding. Since we were all lined up at the door, I couldn’t even make a run for it. I’d have to suffer the consequences of my actions upfront, and there were so many witnesses that it’d be impossible to talk my way out of it.

As I headed to my next class, I hung my head down and expected the worst. Not long before I settled into my desk, I hear an announcement telling me to go to the principal’s office. The impending doom of my parents finding out about this incident contorted my stomach into knots. As soon as I saw the guy I punched, sitting in one of the chairs in front of the principal’s desk, my heart plunged into a spiral of guilt.

There, the principal asks me to explain myself and, because I did feel genuinely sorry for my actions, I spared no expense at apologizing to this dude and to the principal. If I had to bow down on my knees and beg, I would’ve. However, this dude, my victim, was having none of my apology and I don’t blame him.

It’s not that I wasn’t sincere enough but if I were in his place I’d be fucking blasted mad like he was. However, he was so angry that he finally exploded and started swearing like crazy. He swore to the principal, to me and to the school. This was a catholic school and we were like 11 or something at the time so…I’m not sure if venting out the F word (plus other swears I can’t recall) in front of the principal was the best idea. 

As I sat there in my chair, watching this all unfold, I couldn’t expect what the principal was going to do next. Instead of handing me the scrutinizing backseat to watching her call my parents, she tells me to go to class and shuts the door behind her. Now, this didn’t mean that she wouldn’t call my parents later, so I was still petrified. But, when I returned in the middle of class, it was eerily as if nothing ever happened in the first place.

Days, then weeks, pass by since I punched this dude in the face , and two things that were supposed to happen, didn’t. I never got any consequences for my actions and that excruciating phone call from the principal never came. Every day since this incident, it never came to light again (until very later on, but that’s another story.)",2022-01-18 11:25:51

when i was in 8th grade, i had a ton of problems in history in my 2nd half of jr high. i was very good at the first half, i had only 85%+ grades, participated a ton and behaved well. 2nd half was shitty, mostly no tests and i was buying homework and projects. i didnt know anything, and when our big test at the end of the year came, i knew i was done for. 35% of my grade right there, i was so scared, until i realized i could just copy off someone and if i got caught worst case sencario i would have faked something sad so i would be spared. 

i sit next to a pretty smart guy, so i decided to give it a go.

i copy off him (not everything.)

the teacher pulls me aside at the end of a lesson after 2 weeks or so and asks me to go to the office, i'm panicking inside and thinking i'm done, and my heart drops when i see the other kid in the office too, and he asks me if i know whats up. he asks us if any of us has any idea why are we here, i act confused, asking if its about homework or a project, which i think only makes matters look better to me.

he pulls out our tests, i had 88% and he had 93%, and tells us our tests were great, but he sees similarities between not a small amount of answers, and asked us if theres an explanation. i say nothing, and act very confused again. he ""highlights"" the whole point and asked us if any of us copied off the other. i tell him that its a bad coincednce maybe, because i know (guy name) would not do this, as hes a very nice person, and is good in class. i said this in hopes to sound too innocent, agreeing to this was what i wanted him to do and (guy name) agrees and says that i'm completely right, as he didnt copy the test/or i copied the test and it is a mere coincedence. the teacher asks me to get out and wait outside. i didnt hear anything besides muffled voices. he gets out, visibly upset with tears in his eyes and i go ask him whats wrong. he tells me he wants to be left alone, and goes away.

teacher calls me in and asks me if i'm sure i didnt copy or let him copy, i strictly tell him no and act offended. i say i studied for so called test and would never do it, he tells me i have good behavior and overall is a trustworthy student so hes with me. he tells me to stay away from (guy name) and to tell him if anything happens.

that day, my mom was happy with the grade, as i told her its worth, she took me to get my favorite ice cream, it wasnt as sweet.

(guy name) doesnt speak to me, no rumors, no anything. i get 90 in history in my degree (report card we call it degree where i live) 

feels good to get it off my chest, i feel like the teacher was stupid with his decision because we didnt talk at all, i was prepared for a debate and to throw fake lies about times he harrased me or done x to other people, which is what i find worst.",2022-01-17 16:59:56
I used to try to kick pigeons everytime they got near me.,106,s5zs7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/s5zs7g/i_used_to_try_to_kick_pigeons_everytime_they_got/,29,1642410814.0,"In absolutely NO WAY do I condone what I did. 

So I (22f) was an evil little child.
A little backstory, there was an old carwash that me & my grandparents used to love to go to. I liked watching the car go through the ar wash, & then we'd wait for the guys outside of it to finish detailing the car & make it look pretty. They'd have an area where you could get popcorn in the place & a sitting area outside to watch. So watching the carwash & the people detailing was always an event with popcorn to me.

At around 5 years old I was always taken to this carwash, & it was the highlight of my days. I'd sit on a little ledge holding a palm tree & I'd be able to sit with my feet on the ground, I was a short little kid. 

Pigeons were always around, because whenever anyone at the carwash would go, they'd get popcorn & feed it to the pigeons. I used to always throw the popcorn to them & it was so entertaining to watching a bunch of fat, grey birds swarm each other for the food. 

Fast forward to when I was 8,  I had the (not so) bright idea to put the popcorn on my foot, & see if a pigeon would get near. (Spoiler: they did.) Whenever a pigeon would get close & eat the food off my foot, it made me ecstatic. One pigeon managed to get the food, but also nicked me in the ankle. Surprisingly for such a sweet kid with a goldfish attention span, I had a bit of an anger issue. I started to put the popcorn on my foot & kick at the pigeons when they got close. Granted, I wasn't strong enough to do any damage, I did no harm, but I got one in the beak & it flew away & ate from someone else's popcorn. 

My grandparents were PISSED. They took my popcorn away & told me ""you don't EVER hurt an animal, even if it hurt you by accident. They just want to eat, they don't get enough food where they live."" 

I remember sobbing, knowing that hurting animals was bad & I hurt the thing I love most. I was never taken to that carwash again, but my love for animals only grew. I have never hurt a pigeon after that, in fact I've saved a couple on numerous occasions. But child me was a rotten little thing.

The class started and we were asked to pick a group of 3, I didn’t have really much friends at the time so I got stuck with two girls; they were smart, but were lazy and told me to do the work, BUT idk no jack shit on how to make a paper table using the blue tape to hold it together. I tried multiple design but to no avail, I was stuck. Then I looked over at another table. The next table right beside us where rolling up the paper really tightly so it was more stronger, that gave me idea to do the same thing. So I did, I wrapped the paper really tightly until it looked like a cigarette, then I cut it into 4 pieces for each leg of the table, I taped them to 1 sheet of paper for the top part and boom a small paper table, we asked the teacher to go for the test and it worked. Then someone sat their school iPad on the tiny paper table, and it surprisingly held up another then another, then I was the star of the classroom in total the paper table held 14 iPads and a metal water bottle idk how full it was. Then the paper got smushed into a pancake from the weight. I felt really guilty because I did copy of the idea to wrap the table legs tightly together and the attention I got from it. without that idea from my classmate I would’ve never won, I don’t regret what I did though because the person I copied off doesn’t seem to remember it today, but back then he directly accused me of taking off their project.",2022-01-16 16:56:22

For some reason I can't remember she had suspected my best friend  and I ( not sure why cuz we were usually pretty quiet and not the troublemakers during class ) so she pulled us out in the hallway to talk to us and she was PISSED! I literally was in shock and thought we were dead meat, and I was internally thinking ""well.. i may have just screwed my whole life over"". My friend tho seemed confident and said ""I think I know whats going on"" so the teacher told me to go back in the classroom so she could have a 1 on 1 with my friend, when he came back in, I guess we were off the hook. My friend told me he told the teacher that he said that he saw this one really rude girl in our class take them and destroy them. We laughed for hours later that day. Now, I feel really bad about this, because she turned out be real nice like 3 yrs later. But altho she hadent destroyed the calculators, she had done other stuff like stolen other people's things out of their backpacks, so ig thats why my friend blamed it on her. She didnt get in trouble I dont think cuz the teacher I think still suspected it could have been us but didnt have enough evidence either way so she didnt persue it further. But if she did have more evidence against us, we could have gotten a suspension or referral. Whew.",2022-01-15 09:08:22

And he never let an accusation go. I was a terrible liar and he would call me out on my lies immediately. So either he never actually found out or for some inconceivable reason, he was LETTING me STEAL from him! So why did i steal money from my father? Well, the product was always the same, food for me and my friends during free periods, either from the gas station down the road, the pizza place across the park, or the vending machines. But I think it was a combination of me wanting to be seen as the one who loved to feed their friends but I had no money of my own, and me being angry with my dad for being such a hardass raising me and my brother borderline abusively. I only stopped when I got kicked out and I've never lied or stolen since.

Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes and comments. The insight from many of you really made me feel like I wasn't the only one. However, due to some of the comments, i feel like i should elaborate on the ""borderline abusive"" part a bit. 

Maybe its a side effect of abuse to say ""it really wasn't that bad."" But compared to some of you, it really wasn't. He wasn't a drunk. He didnt hit me besides spankings when I was younger, and he only hit my brother 2 times that I can remember my whole life. One of which i believe he actually deserved. He did the best he could I think with how he was mentally and financially equipped. He was a navy seaman in the 70s and we weren't exactly poor but we were not middle class. He was also from a rime when they didnt believe in mental illness or LGBT+. So I was raised like I was in boot camp only without all the P.T. and my mental illness and physical illnesses were constantly being used against me or completely ignored.  the mottos of my childhood of ""c'mon, faster"" and ""do it right the first time, that way you dont have to do it again"" probably wouldnt have been so bad if I wasn't also met with: ""Figure it out."" Everytime I asked for help until I was crying because I couldn't figure the problem out and he was telling me it wasn't that hard and I could just sit there until I did it right.

I once stole an entire deck at a Yugioh Tournament from my opponent,0,s3vgws,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/s3vgws/i_once_stole_an_entire_deck_at_a_yugioh/,33,1642175358.0,"I was at a tournament in Chicago, it was a regional, these are really fun, usually have like 3-600 people at each event.  We go to sit down and we have 45 minutes to basically play 3 games.  So my opponent not only has a very similar deck to me, his is shiny as hell, all of the expensive cards and it's all max rarity meaning literally he spent an arm and a leg to acquire his cards and they all were very expensive and nice, probably 1.5k-2k$ worth of cards in his deck.  Not to mention, he had a full set of all the attribute dice, these dice are limited edition and believe it or not were super expensive, in some situations anywhere from $30-60 per and there were 6.  So he invested a lot into the game.  So very anticlimactically, the guy plays against me and absolutely murders me.  Like it wasn't even close, guy curb stomps the absolute shit out of me and shits in my mouth, swift 2-0, meaning it didn't go to game 3 as it's best 2 out of 3.  Guy beats the absolute living hell out of me and of course i'm not only upset and sad, i'm super salty, now I'm a very gracious player, I would never do anything to hurt, or say anything to a player that beats me, it's part of the game and losing is losing.  The guy takes his backpack and leaves after we both sign the match slip.  But what do I see?  He left his extremely expensive deck box with all of his cards and dice and everything on the table.  I waited about 5-10 minutes for him to come back and reclaim it.  But he was outside of the venue talking with his friends I guess.  So I do what all normal people with a brain do, I take my backpack and place it over the deckbox so it covers it and nobody sees it.  I then got nervous because I saw a judge walk by, but the judge just came to ask me if my match was over.  I stealthily take the deck box and slide it into my bag undetectable.  I just keep looking around the room to see if any cameras were around.  I pack my stuff up and head for the exit, for all I cared I just wanted to go home with my plunder.  One of my friends grabs me from the back as i'm leaving and yells my name and I just froze and realized I was screwed, I was completely frozen, sweating, and spooked, but it was just my buddy asking me how I did, boy had I never been happier to hear his voice and not a judge or officer's.  So I shrugged it off and told him I lost, but he was confused since I looked so damn happy.  I go to the bathrooms immediately to a stall and start putting all of his cards in my binder and throwing the deckbox away and the sleeves for his cards so it can't get traced back to me.  I see the guy who beats me just chilling outside the venue and I don't want the crime to be traced back to me so as match ups are called for the next round I go to my table, acting completely normal.  The look on his face as he goes to his table to sit down, open his backpack and see that his deck wasn't there gave me so much satisfaction.  He suddenly started to panic and freak out, he realized that he didn't have his deck anymore, and at Yugioh Tournaments theft is super super common, i've never been to an event where there wasn't theft or somebody taking or losing something.  Guy goes to where we both played last round looks around sees absolutely nothing.  I played it off cool and just focused on my opponent.  Then cue the announcement from the Judges that a player's deck is missing.  Guy ofcourse has to be disqualified and drop from the tournament.  I play my round, lose to my opponent on purpose, and I was just chilling outside the venue waiting for my friends.  After some time of giving up looking for his things, the guy who beat me walks by and I see him on his way up the escalator to leave and go home so I also leave and gtfo of there.  I go explore the city I had been visiting and then go out to dinner with my friends at night.  I ended up keeping some of the cards, but I sold most of them on Ebay or to people at my locals and made a ton of money.  My whole takeaway from all of this is, be careful who you treat like shit, which my opponent had been super disrespectful the whole match, and also sometimes god finds ways of dropping stuff right in your lap, you just have the balls to take it.

Edit: What I did and the other shit i've done in my life have all been super fked up and are not acceptable.  Don't ever trust anyone, best advice i've ever learned.  Don't talk shit when you can help it, bad people(like myself) exist, watch yourself, and be mindful of how you carry yourself.  Yes in the past  I have stolen a ton, this is a throwaway, I have no Karma lol... so no I have nothing to brag about and nothing to gain, this is my truth, I did this stuff and more, I will continue to confess.",2022-01-14 17:49:18
"Caught somebody stealing cash out of another's pocket. Confronted the thief, returned the money, but only half of it.",916,s3cx8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/s3cx8m/caught_somebody_stealing_cash_out_of_anothers/,54,1642116590.0,"Seven years ago, I was 18 (F) and traveling through SE Asia (this story happened in Vietnam). Me and a bunch of other young tourists I had met at another bar took a few moped-taxis to some different bar. There were some young locals hanging out front, about our age.

One of the tourists got off the moped and was talking to some other people. He had a huge wad of cash just sticking out of his back pocket like the drunk idiots we all were that night. I watched as one of the locals silently motioned for his friends to watch. He dramatically tip-toed over to the tourist, grabbed the wad of cash out of the tourist's back pocket undetected, then was having a good laugh with his friends when I decided to intervene.

I snatched the money out of his hands and said something to the effect of ""stealing ain't cool!"" Their response was the equivalent of ""whatever, man"" and they walked off. Maybe it wasn't smart for a young solo female to fuck with strange men who had just stolen something, but I was drunk and overly confident. Anyways, that's not the story.

I was making my way back to the victim of the theft to give him his money when I separated the wad into two stacks and stuck half of it in my pocket. I gave the guy the remaining cash and told him that I saw it get snatched from his pocket and had gotten it back for him.

He was so grateful. He bought my drinks for the rest of the night and shared his supply of drugs with me. He told anyone who would listen that I was a hero and etc etc etc.

I have no idea why I stole half his money. I don't remember what it added up to, but it wasn't insignificant. I had never stolen anything up to that point, and definitely never again after. I felt SO bad, and still do. Since then, I have had many situations where I've seen somebody drop money (usually in a bar, sometimes elsewhere though). I have always picked it up and returned the money in full to that person. The memory and guilt of what I did instantly comes up whenever I'm in this situation. The last time this happened, a guy at a bar unwittingly dropped a huge wad of 20's onto the ground (must've been several hundred dollars), and I'm very proud that I did the right thing and didn't think twice about picking it up and returning it to him in full.

I'd like to tell myself that I stole the cash because I was drunk, but the reality is, I've been drunk many times and I still know right from wrong. I consciously and intentionally stole a bunch of money from that guy, and only gave him the half of it back so that I wouldn't feel bad about myself.",2022-01-14 01:29:50
I drunkenly crashed my car into a snow bank when I was 18 and got extremely lucky getting away with it.,1614,s2sfmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/s2sfmw/i_drunkenly_crashed_my_car_into_a_snow_bank_when/,133,1642054664.0,"Used to be a pretty big dickhead at that age and had a bit too much money, which led me to be very cocky. Basically got a pretty heavy buzz and was driving my BMW way too fast, hit a turn and went straight over the curb into a giant snow bank. The weather was around -25 Celsius and all i remember was hitting a bend, turning the wheel left and just going straight. It was around 12am and the car was fully stuck. 

I have a good friend who is a tow truck driver and called him and for the first time ever he didn’t answer, so at this point I was fully prepared to have cops show up and be arrested, as there were security cameras pointing in the direction and i knew i smelt like booze and couldn’t do any road side tests. 

Right after this this black dude in a BMW (335i) pulls over, asks me if my car has x drive and helps me push it. As we were slowly getting it un stuck by pushing then putting it in drive and reverse, some random dude walking past ended up coming and pushing with me while the first guy was flooring it in reverse. 

Got the car out, and thankfully there was very minimal exterior damage, as i had an suv and while it jumped the curb, it only pushed through snow and grass, didn’t hit any trees. If it was a sedan or any lower car it would have been worse. I thanked both of them so much and gave them what i had in cash at the time which was around $450. I’m pretty sure they knew i was drunk as shit, as i was slurring, they both were grateful. 

On the bright side i haven’t drove drunk since and never plan to. If i do drink and am driving (i do this maybe 1 day a year, i call Ubers 99% of the time) I’ll have max 2 beers and wait around 3.5-4 hours to fully metabolize any alcohol. I know I got lucky as fuck so quit being an idiot then and there.

Didn’t really pay attention to my wording, both the dudes that helped me were black that was just a detail. Meant nothing out of it aside from detail to the story.

My dad was sentenced to 13-40 years in prison for drugs. When he first got arrested I had to get a Power Of Attorney so I could act on his behalf. He didn't leave a hidden stash of money in case he ever got arrested. So, I had to sell off some of his assets. Specifically, his race horses in order to pay for a lawyer. I was also forced to collect money from people who owed him, and I had to reach out to ""associates"" for help. He was also retired and he received a pension each month. The State froze all of his bank accounts. Including his pension.  The only way to prevent the state from intercepting his pension or any other funds was to open up a joint account. Once I did that I had steady monthly income and a credit card with a huge credit limit. I quit my job to help with his case. I did a lot of leg work,  paper chasing, and constantly having to be in court. I also had to move into his house and take over his truck lease, as well as my car lease. His entire life dropped in mine and my son's ( who he helped raise) lap. He was 9 at the time.

Once my father was sentenced and things settled down a bit he'd send people to the house to make sure were doing ok, or to see if I needed anything. Sometimes they would want me to put money on his books. That went on for about a year and by this point he had a good amount of pension money in bank.  The problem was, I ended up suffering from tremendous anxiety, paranoia and PTSD caused by the entire incident. I had no idea my dad was dealing like that. Now, these may sound like excuses. But, for me they were justifications.  I ended up becoming so angry with him. Especially because he started telling me to invest his money, and fix up his house, buy this, buy that. He'd tell me what he wanted waiting for him when he got home. Money and greed got him into that situation and it ruined my life. He didn't think about that or care about how it would affect my son and I. So, I used his money. I took my son to Disney. We went on vacations. I bought him anything he wanted for Christmas, I bought myself nice things. I even had a good job but I still did it. Why? Because I was bitter. He didn't deserve to get out of prison only to have thousands of dollars to pick up where he left off. So, when he'd CONSTANTLY asked how much money he had I'd lie. I did have intentions on paying it back over time. But he got suspicious and gave my sister POA behind my back. They found out I lied and neither of them have talked to me since. That was 8 years ago.",2022-01-07 17:56:22
I got a fishing hook caught in the birthday boys hand with a terrible cast,187,rxy5g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/rxy5g5/i_got_a_fishing_hook_caught_in_the_birthday_boys/,11,1641528319.0,"Why is this a confession? Surely people saw me. Yes, but not a single one of them knew me.

I was maybe 7-8, and across the street from my house was a park that I'd spent tons of time at. One day while walking around there I'd found a boy almost my age standing at the edge of the pond with a fishing pole. I'd never actually done any fishing, but being the young idiot kid that I was with the confidence of a Car Salesman I walk up to him and say ""I bet I can cast that line farther than you."" The boy obliges and hands me the pole. I hold it in front of me and look out as far as I imagine I can cast it and I whip the fishing line back over my head like a Bass Pro. Before I could throw the cast forward award I'm stopped dead in my tracks by a scream. I look back and this boy is screaming at the top of his lungs and holding onto his hand, and right in his palm is the hook with the barbs sticking through. In some ways it was a perfect cast. If only I'd known to not hold the release on the back swing I may have won that bet. 

At that moment I see the front of his hat, and in big bold letters it says ""BIRTHDAY BOY"". Also at that moment every adult and there were like 15 atleast rush over to us, and I immediately started panicking when I saw the hook and I ran. I ran to the right side of the park and took a strange path back to the back side of my dad's apartment so nobody could follow me. And I played Nintendo 64 the rest of the day and pushed it into the back of my subconscious.


I honestly can't remember if it was stuck in his hand or in his face. I'm pretty sure it was his hand but memory is a tricky thing and I only caught a glimpse of it in flesh. And after he'd been fishing with it. He may have gotten an infection from that seriously gross water. I'm sure he'll never forget that birthday. If your that kid and you see this, know I'm really sorry. I didn't have anyone to teach me how to fish and I just wanted to have a try at it. Hope the rest of your birthdays have been great.",2022-01-07 06:05:19
I stole my best friend's Nintendo DS when I was 9 years old.,144,rxnvtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/rxnvtf/i_stole_my_best_friends_nintendo_ds_when_i_was_9/,33,1641500277.0,"I feel so ashamed even writing this (I am 23 now) but about 14 years ago when I was 9 years old I had this close friend who would invite me over to play, but playing was really watching her play with her toys. She had a lot of great interesting stuff that I usually would watch her play with, as she never let me play with her or offer a turn because these were a lot of singular games she liked to play such as Sims, gameboy etc...  And she was a sweet girl but very spoiled and not always that kind to me looking back, but I wasn't an angel either. Well one year she got a DS for Christmas and whenever I would come over she would play it the whole entire time we were together, ignoring me in the car, the park, her house, everywhere really. I would speak to her and she wouldn't say anything because she was so engrossed in the device. I remember her older sister mentioning to her that she ignored me whenever she invited me around but I don't even know if she heard that lol. I remember a few months later I came over and while she was playing on her computer I got bored and went to the kitchen to ask her mom for water. I saw the DS sitting in her moms open purse in the kitchen and snatched it and put it in my pocket. I have no idea what mental gymnastics my nine year old self did to justify this as I my personality leans to me feeling guilty about EVERYTHING, but not stealing from my best friend?? I did love her and she loved me we spent so much time together and our parents were friends. I actually remember feeling a thrill at the time from knowing I had successfully taken it.

It sickens me that I went home and played with the DS and I really had fun doing it. I remember her parents explaining to mine that she was upset because her new DS was stolen. Her parents got her another one a few weeks later and the guilt was starting to eat me alive and my nine year old brain thought I'd go to jail, so I returned the game that was in the DS to her secretly (she suspected I stole the cartridge but I denied it) but threw the actual DS away for some reason. Thinking about how evil I was for that is shocking and disturbing. It took until right before I was about to turn ten years old for me to realize that what I did was so wrong and selfish and that I hurt her by stealing her Christmas present and took money away from her parents as Nintendo DS' were expensive. I hate myself thinking about how awful she must've felt when she realized her favorite new toy was gone. I ended up throwing her a huge 10th birthday with the help of my mom (who had no idea) and I anonymously gifted her about $100 I saved because I felt so bad. I still have never said anything to her or anyone else about it from the shame. I don't know where she is now but I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find her. I sometimes wonder if I should find her and confess to her that I did it or if that would hurt her even more so I should carry the guilt with me and move on? For some reason it took that experience for me to fully understand that stealing is wrong and extremely hurtful. I never stole anything again after that, and in hindsight this incident it is probably why I am quick to accept fault and admit to any wrongdoing I'd done after that. I wish so badly that I could go back and behave correctly. Forgiving myself for my childish transgression is extremely difficult. How do you forgive your past self for things that you would **NEVER** do now?",2022-01-06 22:17:57

We’d missed a recycle day due to snow so we hadn’t been able to keep up with stuff we normally put on the curb exacerbating things. 

Well the day came and I had everything separated into piles and planned on swinging by the goodwill and then the dump/recycling center and knocking it. First, the Goodwill was closed for donations and then the cardboard containers were full and they weren’t taking that either. I’d been busting my hump to load and get it out of there so I said fuck it, it’s all going in the trash! 

I feel terrible because of the recyclables and some pretty decent stuff that could have been donated but I couldn’t stand the thought of bringing it home and unloading. I’ve dedicated my career to working for the environment and salmon recovery but I just had to do it! My garage looks great by the way.

I stole a classmates DSi while in gym class and he knew I stole it.,0,rwt7s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/rwt7s8/i_stole_a_classmates_dsi_while_in_gym_class_and/,67,1641406553.0,"One day during PE in high school, another student brought in his DSi to show the rest if the class (he was a little odd). I didn't like this guy because he and I were in the same woodworking class and he'd be a dick to me and a friend cause he felt the need to around the upperclassmen in the class.

I was cool with the upperclassmen and still know one of them as of now, but like I said, he was a little odd. I'm sure he was just trying to be cool like them, but he was still an asshole.

During PE, he whipped his DSi out and started showing it off for no reason. And I wanted his DS. I already have had a DSi, a regular DS, and a 3DS. All bought by myself at the time. But since I didn't like him, I wanted to take his.

After our warmups, we were instructed to run around the perimeter of the inside of the building of our gym. During our run, I noticed the locker room was unlocked and open. I snuck inside while no one was running down the hallway and opened my classmates backpack. Luckily he didn't have a lock for a locker. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to reach his DSi. I took it from his backpack and put it in mine inside my locked locker.

Unfortunately for me, when I came out of the locker room, my classmate who I stole from witnessed me exiting the locker room. I knew problems were going to arise from this later, but after that class and the rest of the day, things were fine.

The day following the next (we had a schedule of doing even class periods one day and odd class periods the following day) he confronted me. He knew I stole his DSi, but I came up with a bullshit stupid ass lie on the spot that my friends vouched for. They did not know I stole his DSi nor did I tell them to vouch for me. I said I fell off my roof after helping re-shingle it and went to the locker room that day to take my pain medicine.

I do not feel bad for stealing his DSi and have only told one other person besides all of Reddit. And if you're reading this, classmate who I stole from, fuck you. I'll do it again.",2022-01-05 20:15:53

I told a friend at school about the contest. She writes a really good poem. Or maybe her mom does idk. She gives me the poem to turn it into this store. I never got to go back to that store.

The other girls mother confronted me about the poem. Telling me that she knew I never turned the poem in. I did not argue with her. She says she called the store & they checked it out. Yup, no poem.

Basically I grew up in a wealthy household, but our parents raised us to think we were super poor or at best average, we were spoiled in that we didn't want for anything, but I never had a ton of ""nice things"".  I grew up being a chunky kid, went off to college and gained even more weight, so much so that I was approximately 430lbs at some point.  I was depressed, had severe sleep apnea, and kind of just wanted to die.  Nobody would look at me or act like I was there and it was super hard making friends.  The few friends I did have were ones I made while playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game.  I learned early on that if you pulled or had super expensive cards that people admired you and for a moment when I had like one good or expensive rare card I felt a thrill.  Like food though, that thrill was only temporary, and then you return to realize you're a 400+lb loser.  I had an incident when I was ordering some cards in which I ordered a card, but it never arrived.  I filed it missing and got my money back.  Month later card shows up, was apparently lost in the mail.  I for a second felt nothing but fear, then overcame a thrill I had never felt before.  I remembered that feeling and decided that I was going to start chasing it.  It stopped being about the cards or anything else besides that thrill, so that for 5 seconds I don't feel like i'm a 400lb loser, but someone with some cool cards.  I started scamming all sorts of websites and people.  I would go to tournaments and if someone's deck turned up missing, you could bet I was swiping them.  I was getting cards anyway that I could.  Whether it was on Ebay or in tournaments.  I hungered for that feeling.  I felt the world gave up on me so I gave up on everything else.  My risk tolerance had gone to that of a suicidal maniac, I felt I had nothing to lose and I acted like it.  I went and bought fast food everyday hoping that would kill me and I'd get a massive heart attack.  I was willing to steal, scam, lie, and cheat and do whatever I wanted to feel that thrill.  Before I knew it I had a small fortune of a collection that I had amassed over about a year and a half.  It was the end of the semester when I was supposed to graduate and I had been failing all my classes, not even showing up, this had been going on throughout my whole college experience, and I had lied to my parents about my grades and all my classes, changed my major a bunch of times.  I figured that I lived a life, a shitty one, but I lived, so I attempted to kill myself twice before the semester was over.  Both overdoses never took, and the second one was actually when my parents had come to check on me since I wasn't answering calls.  They found me passed out in my room and had me sent to the hospital.  From there I went to the psychiatric ward.  Since then, I've made many changes including getting healthier, dealing with mental problems, sleep apnea solution, exercise, diet, and I've lost 200lbs, I finished school and got my degree, and I have accomplished a lot.  One thing though, when I was allowed to go home, my parents told me they went to my college apartment and got all of my belongings.  They asked about my safe and why I had one, and I simply told them that it was for my passport and other stuff(all my cards were in there, in sleeves, mint condition).  I take all of the cards and put them in a safety deposit box and haven't touched them since, they just sit in my bank.  Last I looked up their prices from when I bought them 2016-2017 are upwards of $150-200,000 depending on ranges and if I choose to grade.  I intend to eventually donate that money to some charity or someone who deserves it more than me.  I hope people know that bad people can change, and not everyone is in the same situation you are.  Empathy is huge, and it is important to track your items you sell online!!!!",2022-01-04 21:23:47

Nothing new besides me getting used to the humidity of the east coast part of my country since my family moved when this happened. I was with my family most the day, chatting playing games and making food. Fast forward it comes time for me to do my online college class (I honestly regret joining in the first place) I got up into my room and got everything up and running. Got class up and running, paperwork, etc. So I’m sitting at my desk and I decided, whatever the teacher is just giving the intro for the class today I’m going to play a game on my phone for a quick bit until he stops and then I’ll pay attention. 

Then all a sudden my sister barges into the room and sees me completely distracted and not paying attention to what the teacher is showing and she just punches me in the ribs on my side really really hard.  Then She said “You’re supposed to be doing your class not messing around on your phone. She punched me again, same spot, one more time same spot. Right after that last hit she gave me I turned quickly 180 and just got the gnarliest right hook to her cheek. She stumbled back and was startled of course, but then she  proceeds to pull me from my chair while my class is going and keeps going at me. So by this point I’m confused and absolutely pissed. I charged and I grabbed her one hand by the throat and threw her across my room onto the bed, putting a hole in the wall where her head had hit. I then proceeded to get on her where I just went at her face heavy with my fists but she but had her hands covering her face. So I just started punching her hands. Eventually sometime between swings I grabbed whatever I reached for on my right side which happened to be her phone, (she placed it there apparently or it fell from her pocket when I threw her) I quickly grabbed it throwing it into my hand and came down with another heavy hit to her hand, when all a sudden I heard the most disgusting sort of crack noise of my life. 

She starts screaming absolutely bloody murder. Lifts her hand from her face, (looked like a murder scene ) thumb was broke, 3 other fingers broke, back of her hand felt like mush from me bashing on it so hard and her wrist was fucked up too. I got her dominant hand too which upset her even more. The next few weeks /months when she was in a cast, (she was in nearly 2-4months I think)she’d be like trying to spread jelly on toast but couldn’t close her hand or hardly even move the damn thing. She’d cuss/ throw things, cry, I’d laugh at her everytime she did one of these things. Sometimes she’d hear me or see me peeking in on her. Fuck man definitely hate myself for what I did. 

She also can’t really live anywhere to cold due to the metal plates and screws they had to put in. Another thing is she had to completely relearn how to use her hand. Wiggling, bending, closing, so on, so on. Cause apparently I completely destroyed her hand, which at the time I didn’t care but now. Sheeeeesh. I’ve been getting help too, ever since that day or did I should say. Don’t blame her for signing up for all these fighting classes.. And she still just randomly hits me till this day.

Edit: chopped it a bit didn’t really care to re read and segment it off perfectly. English isn’t a first for me so sometimes I forget to do things like that.",2022-01-04 11:26:43

I stole money at my old job and blamed it on another cashier,31,rtyl7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/rtyl7b/i_stole_money_at_my_old_job_and_blamed_it_on/,19,1641088532.0,"I used to work part-time at a grocery store and my job role was working the customer service desk and then in the accounting office where I would count down all the drawers and make sure we come out even, and then also enter in the total dollar amount of coupons received,  Western Union transactions, food stamps, and utility payments. How our system was set up, every cashier had their own password to login to the register and it would help track what transactions they have had. Depending on how many cashiers we have working that day, we may have 6 cashiers on one register. If that register was short at the end of the day, we wouldn't know which cashier had messed up. But, if the same cashier is on different drawers that all end up being short then it would raise red flags. Without them knowing, we would make sure they starts their shift with a whole new drawer and when they are off we would count it down to see if they break even or not.  

&#x200B;

When I was 21 I was only working 1-2 shifts a week here because I had just started  full-time somewhere else and I liked what I did so I figured I would work for some extra cash. There was a 17 year-old cashier who was just a nightmare because she was rude to other workers and sometimes to customers.  She would make mistakes and we would correct her, but she just disregarded anything we told her and kept doing the wrong things knowing it would make everyone else's shift more difficult. She would call out often and it would typically be a super short-notice. When she would show up, she would turn off her register light without notifying anyone and just wander off with one of the bag boys. My biggest pet peeve would be helping her with something and then not having her say ""thank you"". Grinds my freaking gears. She had just gotten flagged for being on multiple drawers where there is a shortage so we had just started giving her a clean drawer. The start of one Saturday night shift she showed up 45 minutes late without calling us to let us know which just made me even more annoyed at the fact I was here until 10 pm on a Saturday night. It was during winter break and all my friends were visiting home from college and I had plans to meet them at a Christmas party being held by some other friends from high school and we were going to go out to the bars afterwards. So I am basically counting down the minutes for me to be able to shut down the customer service desk at 9 PM so I can close out the drawers and make the nightly deposit so I could leave at 10. At 8:57 this lady comes to the desk just absolutely *enraged* at what just happened with her cashier. Now let the record show, I am all for taking down entitled customers and I know 99% of the time, they are just ungrateful cunts. However, this lady was justifiably pissed. She was a regular and I recognized her and have always remembered her as being very pleasant. If a cashier had ever messed up her transaction she would always be very understanding about it. This night, she had put down about 10 coupons that were taken, but never scanned, and her total came out  even higher because all of her produce was rang up incorrectly even thought they all had stickers of their codes. She had asked the cashier if she scanned the coupons before paying and the cashier ignored her at first and then without making eyesight said ""ya. slide your card"". I went to grab the coupons so I could re-ring the order correctly and instead of putting them in her drawer, she just threw them away, which is a huge NO in training because we send them in to the companies after being redeemed and we have to account for it in our records.  She grabbed them from her garbage can, I re-rang up this ladies huge order with everything being correct, wrote her a $20 gift card, and listened to her vent. All of this lasted about 45 minutes, which put me super behind schedule and meant I would be leaving late. I had checked camera footage and saw her grab the coupons and immediately throw them in the trash and I think I went red with rage. At the end of the night, I counted her drawer down and it came out even. I had just remembered the chat with my manager earlier that day where she was being given a clean drawer that needed to be counted after every shift, so before I entered anything into my system I decided that my job is going to be paying for my drinks that night. I knew where the cameras were in the office, so I recount the money a couple times to make it seem like I knew I was coming up short and just triple checking to make sure I was right. Then I put a $100 bill in on top of the other bills before I walked out of the camera shot  and I grabbed it when I was in the clear and pocketed it. Afterwards, I put in she was  $90 and some odd change short, that way when I had my countdown of everything  at  the very end I would come out completely even and not be suspected. Before I clocked out, I left a note for my manager to call my Monday afternoon about the issue with the cashier and the customer  and then I left. That night I bought a round of drinks for my friends and spent all $100 and had a blasty blast. By my next shift, we were replacing that cashier's next few shifts because she was finally let go for being GARBAGE. Do I feel bad? ABSOLUTELY NO. 

For the record, I know she was 17 and working a HS job. She definitely can call out a time or 2 so she can have fun with her friends and by all means, slack off at work it's not that serious. But please do not make  other people's jobs harder by going out of your way to make incorrect choices and being a certified thundercunt. 

TLDR; Stole $100 at work but finessed the accounting system to pin it on another cashier who was in high school and they ended up getting fired.",2022-01-02 03:55:32

My mother made all of us transfer to great schools in the city with my grandparents while my parents stayed in our province to work. My dad was mostly in another province to take care of business so I barely see him compared to my mom, she made sure to check on us every weekend even though transportation fees cost about 1000 pesos (about 20 USD) or more.

The school that I stated in the first paragraph, was one of the best Chinese schools in the city. I had a hard time fitting in because I was from the province and went to very small schools and this school was huge with tons of students (all girls). Most of the students were very rich and I barely had anything to show off (I always wanted to compare myself to others as a child). I was in grade school, Grade 6, ages 13 maybe, my allowance was only 20 pesos (0.40 cents?) with packed lunch but I always wanted to buy food and snacks from the canteens which weren't enough at all. My classmates had about 100 pesos or more as their allowance and of course, I was envious. 

I was very envious of almost everything. The bags they wore, the pens they used, and the newest toys they had. There was this trend going around too, it was the first release of alcogels in cute cases where you hang them in bags. Everyone had them of course and I was the only one who didn't. I refused to ask my mom for them because I knew she was already having a hard time with money so as a desperate child who wanted it her way, I tried stealing an alcogel from someone and got caught. My teacher confronted me about it and I kept lying, thinking it was working but in the end I gave it back anyway, feeling shameful while my classmates were talking about me.

Every year in my school, we had a huge scholastic book fair where we can buy books from. I loved reading books as a child but they were very expensive, especially the ones I wanted. I tried stealing from there multiple times and I guess I succeeded about once, the other tries I pussied out but besides from books, I started stealing smaller things like pens, pencil cases, or just random stuff in classrooms while no one was there. Christmas came by and it was heaven for me as a kid, we had Christmas parties and received tons of small gifts from each classmate, I was so desperate for more gifts to the point where I went to other classrooms when no one was there and stole so much and I was so happy. We also had these business bazaars where we needed to sell things, I was so impulsive, I bought every item from another student's business and they were expensive. I was too ashamed to cancel my orders because I would look poor in front of them (well maybe I already looked poor to them, I wasn't just aware). I was too shy to ask my mom and grandparents for money since I needed a lot so what I did instead was, wait for my grandparents to lay out our allowances on the table for each of us siblings to get and I took each one of ours. They had arguments about who took it or where it went. I felt so guilty trying to hide it but I think they knew but never told me. 

I also had a tutor, we had to go to our tutors' house to study. She was also very wealthy and nice, I stole stuff from her house and I felt very guilty about it since she treated us like family but I don't know why that didn't stop me, I was such a selfish kid who didn't know better. At one point, she found out I stole something from her and she confronted me about it telling me if I didn't apologize, she'd tell my mom, I was scared shitless. I didn't want to bother my mom anymore and yet here I am. It took me about an hour until I apologized, tired of standing and getting scolded. I was too scared to steal again and that's when I stopped for good (thank you, Miss Rosalie).

In the end, I was too sad and lonely to stay in the school in the city, I wanted to go back to my province with my mom. She felt sad and made us transfer back. After a few years, she said she regretted making us transfer back here to the province because we could have gone to better schools in high school and we would have learned more. I spent my junior high school in the province and went back to the city for my senior high school and college (I'm currently in 2nd year). She honestly had no problem with where we are right now, she just wanted better schools for us. I love her with all my heart, thank you, mom and dad :)

If you reached the end, thank you for spending time to read my story as a child who stole lol and I apologize for the long-ass paragraphs.",2021-12-22 02:46:30
I blamed my classmate for sharting on the floor at my ninth birthday,754,rlpzk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/rlpzk0/i_blamed_my_classmate_for_sharting_on_the_floor/,51,1640125914.0,"It was after dinner on my ninth birthday sleepover. At the time, one of the funny things to do in our group was pull our pants down, spread our cheeks and scream:

“CHUCK A BROWNEYE!”

I thought it would be funny to “Chuck a brown-eye” for everyone, but take it to another level by releasing a fart.

When I felt one building, I pulled my pants down, turned my backside to the group and spread my cheeks.

“CHUCK A BROWNEYE!” *SPluurrrt Pffffff Pffffff* *Plop Plop*

I felt something hard come out and bounce twice on the carpet. 

“Oooooohhhhh groooosssss!” 

“DISGUSTING!” Screamed the chorus. 

I looked on the ground to see a small, perfectly formed piece of marble shaped poo, staring back at me. 

The next day at school, I knew my reputation was at stake. When the bell rang for lunch I raced to tell all my friends that last night at the party my friend *Sam chucked a brown-eye, farted and a piece of poo came out and bounced on the carpet. Everyone was aghast. 

For the rest of school *Sam became known as the guy that brown-eye sharted at a party. He used to come up to me and say “why did you do that, you know it was you!”. I had more social clout than him so I guess I was able to get away with it.

To this day it is one of the most dishonourable things I’ve ever done. I’m sorry *Sam! I’m sorry for pinning my poo pebble on you and staining your reputation. I hope you can forgive me.",2021-12-22 00:31:54

There’s many examples I can give but I’ll give one that may bring up some emotions in people. I’ve been doing shit like this since I was a small kid and I’m somewhere between 20 and 30 now. 

I live in a block of flats and my flat is on the bottom floor right by the main entrance. In November last year I walked out my door to see a giant package leaning against the wall by my door and I decided to have a look to see who’s it was. I saw that it was for my neighbour, not in the same block as me but in the building next door. I googled the code on the box and saw it was a particular item that I won’t name but was worth a fair bit of money. I decided it was now mine and took it inside and unboxed it. About half an hour later the delivery driver knocks on my window and asks me if I’ve seen the package as he delivered it to the wrong house. I say “no I’ve not seen it, have you checked my other neighbours?” He asks me to knock on my neighbours door and enquire about the lost package which I do so with him watching without a problem. 

He says okay thank you and walks away. 10 minutes later the delivery driver comes back with my neighbour to my front door. The neighbour is now asking me questions and I tell him the same thing, no I haven’t seen it. I end up helping the guy look for the package. I offer him suggestions as to what could have happened. You see my building has an 8ft gate which was left open, I know this for a fact because this delivery driver didn’t have the code for the gate. I explained that we live in a shady area and I’ve caught people trespassing here before (I gave him several examples, all real examples). I asked the delivery driver whether he closed the gate on his way out and he told me he did but I insisted he can’t have and that’s why the package was gone because someone saw him deliver it and took it when he left. Not only that but the main door to the building shouldn’t be accessible to anyone other than residents so he shouldn’t have been able to get inside to deliver the package anyway. I essentially blamed it on him.

The neighbour, obviously wanting answers proceeds to tell me that it was his kids Christmas present and his son is now crying because he was expecting the package and now it’s gone. I assume he thought this would get me to confess due to guilt but tbh I felt a bit insulted that he thought that tactic would work so I doubled down and gave him my phone number. I told him I would ask my other neighbours if they’ve heard/seen anything and text him when I hear back. Well I just didn’t end up texting him because I didn’t want to be caught out in a lie and I had no intention of talking to my neighbours. He text me asking if there was any news, I said no. 

He began accusing me rather quickly, telling me he was going to jump my fence and look for the package himself in the building. I told him no that’s not gonna happen as I have dogs and I don’t want him to be put in danger as my dog is very protective. He persists and it’s getting rather annoying now so I say something to the effect of listen mate I’ve tried helping you, I’ve asked neighbours, looked for the package, offered ideas as to what happened and now you’re harassing me for no reason. I have autism (I actually do) and you’re causing me to feel extremely uncomfortable in my own home threatening to jump my fence. I told him to take it up with the delivery company and after a couple hours back and forth he left me alone.

I really don’t feel bad, especially because he tried to guilt trip me. I use that thing I stole every day.",2021-12-21 15:21:04

This morning I woke up and from my balcony I could see there was a car parked right next to mine, and by right next I mean our side view mirrors were almost touching. 

Now, I'm not a small person by any means, I'm a fat fuck and I need at least the ""recommended"" distance between cars so I can enter my car (like two feet, idk). By the look of it, there's no way I would be able to get in. Side note: there was plenty of space for this person to park the right way.

So I took a deep breath and wrote a note. Bear in mind, I never do shit like this because I'm terrified of karma and shit like that, also afraid of people seeing me and confronting me. I'm embarassed from what I wrote lol 

""People in cars parked next to yours need to have space to enter their cars. Next time don't be an asshole and park properly. Have a shitty day :-)"" 

I walked to my car and realised shit was worse than I thought. I couldn't even open my goddamned door. If there was anyway I could enter my car, I wouldn't put the note on their windshield, but this was not it. I could be the skinniest person and wouldn't be able to get in. 

I put the note and opened the passenger's door and had a terrible time getting to the driver's seat. I'm fat. We're not supposed to do shit like this lol I was sweating like a turkey on south american Christmas, I was so mad.

I opened the window, grabbed my keys and scratched their car as I was leaving. 

I'm afraid I might get caught because there are plenty security cameras on this block, but at the same time I hope this is a message to this piece of shit driver to stop being inconsiderate.",2021-12-16 14:38:06
When I was younger I punched my little brother and then deleted the evidence...,238,rhnxup,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/rhnxup/when_i_was_younger_i_punched_my_little_brother/,22,1639650280.0,"I would have been around 10 years old and he would have been about 5. We where playing with a toy (Playschool or Fisherprice) cassette recorder that had an attached microphone. We would take turns singing or pretending to be radio DJs and then listen to the playback. I can't recall exactly how we ended up arguing, I believe he felt it was his turn and I wouldn't pass him the toy. In the scuffle I lashed out and accidentally punched him in the eye with the plastic microphone. 

Luckily (or not so lucky considering its such bad parenting) my grandmother was the only person home and never had the time to deal with our shit. So when my brother burst into tears and ran downstairs screaming her name, I ran behind him shouting ""HE'S LYING, HE'S LYING!""... 

God knows why, but regardless of the fact that he was crying and clearly in pain, my grandmother took my side and told him to ""STOP TELLING TAILS""! My brother sulked for the rest of the day (poor lad) and I went back upstairs to find the cassette recorder still running and had captured everything. 

So I did what any remorseful sibling would do... I panicked and quickly deleted the evidence. 

I have since then admitted to my brother what happened. He's now in his 30s and reminds me every Christmas of how terrible I am... with a smile.",2021-12-16 12:24:40

I put an ad on facebook marketplace and he didn’t even ask if they were real or not, he was immediately willing to buy and seemed very happy with them.

Idk why, I didn’t think about or tried to justify it in my mind, maybe the money got to me ( I made $400 from one sale.)

But the worst part, the worst fucking part is that it was a high school kid who didn’t know better. I took advantage of someone less able then me for money.

I feel so scummy, last night I had nightmares all night long. I saw the kid and even felt more guilty and woke up suddenly, sweating, terrified, and almost crying. Im a shitty person and I honestly never thought I could go this low but God I just feel so awful. I wish I could undo it and give him all my money, but I can’t. 

I hate myself and what i’ve become because of my greed.

UPDATE: Thank you all for being brutally honest and telling me what I needed to hear. I wrote this post and went to bed (hence why I didn’t respond) and just woke hearing everything I need to hear. The reason I can’t contact him is because I made a facebook account to sell them and I deleted it afterwards, But I’m gonna contact facebook to try and recover my account. I’ll keep you all updated.  Again thank you for humbling me because honestly I totally needed it.

SECOND UPDATE: 
Thank you all for giving me the humbling I needed. Thanks to one of the comments, I realized I have 30 days to login to the account to get it back so I did and I messaged him. He was really thankful that I told him and was honest, and I sent the money back to him. I also told him he can keep the shoe and he was really happy to hear it. I’m glad I decided to do this, I’m 19 and Just recently I’d been thinking about the type of man I want to become, and this made me realize I never wanna become someone who takes advantage of the weak and vulnerable. Love you guys.

Final Update: Thank you guys so much, your kind words and actions honestly mean the world to me. This has been a growth opportunity for me and really helped me choose my values as I grow up everyday. I have included below some links to screenshots of the convos in case any of you guys are curious. I love all of you guys and will never forget this ❤️

One day on school grounds but before school he showed up to our usual spot claiming he heard the teachers were going to search the lockers for drugs/alcohol/cigarettes and he needed a place to store his pack of Marlboro. He quickly asked if I could hold them till later in the day since I was housed in a different building due to my grade level. I told him I’d take them on. Later in the day after no search was conducted the guy showed up during lunch period and was like ‘where are my smokes’ and I told him I didn’t know but I could tell him where MY cigarettes were. He kept laughing at first but quickly realized I wasn’t giving them back, he was totally helpless and had no idea how to handle himself and this situation. Essentially I told him he could complain to a teacher if he’d like but I wasn’t giving shit to anyone that didn’t belong to him. Kid never came back to hang around, though he found another friend group that ended up fucking him over worse and he ended up leaving school mid year.

I am a female 28 y/o and I work in a grocery store. I have been working there for 9 months, and work conditions are okay at best. We are undermanned and the bosses are saying one thing and doing another, and are not good at following up issues that arise.

I have been working under an abnormal agreement. I get paid for my work, but my employer get refunded above half of my pay for me being there.

I don't mean to come across as obnoxious or full of myself, but I do a really good job; especially with customer service, which is a HUGE part of my job. I have many customers who vocally appreciate my service, and it truly gives me joy to put in the extra effort.

Then there is the shoplifting. I mostly steal booze and stuff that aren't expensive. I feel bad when doing it, probably mostly caused by the fear of being caught, but I justify it by the fact that the employer pays as much for me as they do for 2-3 employees.

I know that that is not reason enough to do what I do, but, for lack of better words; I can't help it. I work 5 days a week, and I hardly have any salary left after all my bills are paid.

I have no idea why I am writing this post here, really.

Maybe someone can help me stop doing it by pointing out the severity of it?  
Maybe someone can help me stop doing it by making me more aware?

Someone dropped $200 on the ground at my job and I pocketed it after they left,1114,raq5xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/raq5xb/someone_dropped_200_on_the_ground_at_my_job_and_i/,219,1638849681.0,"This happened a while ago, and while this isn’t justification for it (just a reason for it at the time)—I was in a really rough spot. I’m also a college student, and in a financially abusive household, so my savings have been depleting significantly. Things repeatedly kept going wrong for me and my mental health (while not much better now) was starting to teeter towards suicidal ideation. I was just hoping for something to finally look up for me, as everything at that time that could have gone wrong was going wrong. It even came to a point where I was scared of being kicked out of my house over small things like forgetting to put my car in gear (I have a stick) when I got home. 

Anyways, later on at night one day at work, I was on the SCO register monitoring the terminals. It was pretty busy, so there was a lot of foot traffic. However, once things started to slow down, I noticed something on the floor: it was a huge wad of cash. For how long it was sitting there is debatable, but I originally put it up next to my register just in case anyone came back for it. If I had alerted my manager, they would have taken it and put it into funds for store use. This is a huge chain company, and honestly that $200 wouldn’t be doing much for them. And that means the person who lost it wouldn’t be getting it back anyway—especially if they didn’t come back for it ASAP.

About two hours had gone by, and no one had come back for it. I decided then maybe this was some sign from the universe my luck had turned around and I covertly slipped it into my pocket. A few minutes later I asked someone’s to cover me to use to bathroom, pulled out the money and counted it—a solid $200. I’ve been holding onto it to use for a vacation in January ever since.

From time to time I can’t help but wonder if the person who dropped their money ever noticed that it was gone. I feel bad about it, but it was an act of impulse during a rough time and there’s nothing I can do to fix it now. 

Just wanted to get it off my chest.

Edit: Y’all are treating this like a AITA post. That’s not the point of a confession post guys. Clearly most of you haven’t read my post. I said I WAS in a rough spot—I’m still not entirely better, but at that point, I wasn’t doing ok whatsoever. And there was absolutely NO WAY to find who dropped the money. Hundreds of people pass by SCO (self checkout) every day, and we get hundreds of people in a couple of hours going through. I don’t know how long that money was there for, didn’t see who dropped it, and after holding onto it to see if anyone would come back for it for a couple of HOURS, that’s when I made my choice. It was almost closing time, and the management would have put the money towards store expenses rather than hold onto it any longer. 

And the vacation was already planned earlier on in the year. I was close to pulling out, but that $200 is what made me not. I never said what I did was right—I know it’s not—but it’s too fucking late to do anything about it now. Stop treating me like I can still do something to fix it when there’s no way to find the person who lost it. It’s been months.

Edit 2: Also. I would have fucking returned the money to the person if I saw who dropped it. It’s not like I outright stole from someone, please stop treating my situation as if I outright saw someone lose their money and decided to keep it anyways. You clearly can’t read and are just making assumptions based off the little you decide to skim. 

Also, the store I work for is one people spend a lot of money at. The person who dropped their money likely still had plenty in their bank account. It’s normal for people to spend THOUSANDS in each transaction. Yes, they could have been poor, but once again, there’s no way for me to tell that given I never fucking saw them.

Final edit: I should have stated this a lot earlier but the vacation is basically a mental health trip. I thought that was implied with the mentioning of getting away from a toxic environment but I guess not. It’s not something I’m willing to give up because being home in the state it’s at pushing me to once again: to brink of suicidal ideation. I’m not ok, and while I don’t have the funds for consistent therapy, I should be allowed to do something that would help.",2021-12-07 06:01:21

Well one night we decided to do this and on the way back to his parents apartment, for some reason, we decided to start drop kicking random mailboxes on the side of the road that we were walking down. We broke between 6-8 mailboxes. The last one we had done, someone across the street noticed it and yelled, ""HEY, HEY, STOP"". This scared us so we started booking it back to our destination. We knew they would probably call the cops with a certain description as to what we were wearing so we changed everything. I took my hat, glasses off and borrowed some of his clothes. He changed his clothes as well. When the cops arrived, we were questioned. They were told that there were 3 guys doing it when there was just two of us and the description to a tee of what we looked like 10 minutes prior. However we weren't the guys that matched that description anymore. We got away with it. I know we were wrong and definitely deserved jail time but it has been a funny story to tell others.

My dad had gotten sick and, being that they both worked a lot, she needed the extra help once a week. She was a very sweet woman that we all liked a lot, and she’d leave the house looking spotless.

One day in October, my mom had left out a big bowl of Halloween candy on the dining room table. This was around the time that I started having major issues with binge eating. I took just a couple of pieces at first, but before I knew it I’d eaten half the bowl. My mom was a very strict parent and you definitely couldn’t take food, especially sweets, without asking first. I knew I’d get in trouble for taking that much, along with receiving some heavy body shaming, so I was hoping she just wouldn’t notice. She did. 

She asked me and my siblings repeatedly if we’d taken the candy. We all denied it of course. She dwelled on it for the rest day and I just kept saying I didn’t know what happened. This also happened to be a Saturday, which was the day Sarah would come by. My mom concluded that if none of us had taken the candy, it must have been her. I felt guilty that my mom thought Sarah had done this, but I was too scared to speak up. 

The next week, Sarah didn’t show up. I asked my mom where she was, and she told me that she’d let her go. She said that she hadn’t confronted Sarah about the candy, only telling her that we appreciated her work but no longer needed her services. I asked why and my mom said, “Listen, OP, if there’s one thing I know about business, it’s that if someone feels comfortable stealing something small, then they’ll start to feel comfortable stealing bigger things. It’s not worth the risk.” I was silent.

It’s about 10 years later and I still think about this from time to time. I cost Sarah her job for something I did, and I never owned up to it. I just let her take fall.",2021-12-03 05:31:28

At some point people started complaining about stuff being stolen from their lunch boxes, it wasn’t me but it stuck in my mind.

Now middle school me was a whole other breed (as many other people can relate to). I was in a group with the ‘popular kids’ and the excess attention caused me to become very self conscious. It got to the point where I would skip meals or was generally very picky with what I would eat because I hated the way I looked in photos with friends or was too insecure about what I looked like doing literally anything. So I usually gave into these preteen food cravings while I was alone, this usually being in the locker rooms. 

I kind of liked it when people would question things going missing around me if I was the one to do it. But I still feel horrible to this day as some people had very little in their lunch and I still took from them.

I started with a genuine interest in working for a cool outdoor gear shop for a few months while on a work visa overseas. I had planned to spend several months traveling and camping and this job would be a great way to make a few bucks and maybe get discounts on some gear along the way.

Almost immediately I discovered that the owner was a complete douche. However, he wasn’t the active kind of douche who would berate people or be a dick. He was the passive kind of corporate douche who would doctor his employees timecards right before payday and chop off the early starts and late closes that he insisted on to keep his multiple shops running. At the holiday season our store got a huge box of overstock products from one of our top brands labeled as thank you gifts for the staff because they had a great sales year and knew that we, on the sales floor, were the biggest reason. He opened the box, saw what it was, tossed the labels in the trash, put price tags on the items and sent us out to put them on the shelves.

So, one day I took a small piece of camping gear that I wanted off the shelf and just left with it after I closed. It was a small bottle of water purifier tablets worth about $5. A week later I took another and another. After a while I started taking big stuff like jackets and sleeping bags worth hundreds of $s, then clearing them from the inventory. This went on for months, one thing at a time, until I had replaced most of my stuff, and then I quit.

A year or so later, some of the friends I had made at that job told me that the entire chain of that store had been shut down. High shrink, disgruntled staff, and poor performance overall. The parent company for whom the douche owner was only a franchisee threw in the towel and bought him out, then pulled back their entire brandname in that country. A lot of people lost their jobs. 

It’s been 15 years. I still feel morally off balance even though I justified it at the time. Some of the items I took are still in my camping box, and every time I look at them, I still wonder how much my actions may have contributed to others’ hardship…


EDIT: I admit that stealing is wrong, and not justified by others doing it first.

There was a girl named Mae in my second grade class. She was very poor, often wore dirty, floor-length dresses, her hair was unkept, and she wore old shoes. She was also very shy, and looking back, I remember Mae as being nice and sweet to everyone.  Still, for some reason, my second-grade brain was grossed out by her. Whenever I saw her, I would immediately point at her with a disgusted look, and say in a disgusted, loud tone, ""Ewwwwww... Maeee!"", no matter who was around. I would tease her about her hair and clothes. She would never respond or look up at me. She kept her head down and absorbed my ridicule. This went on for at least half of the school year. Nobody else made fun of her like I did.

She didn't live in my little town very long, and I don't ever remember seeing her after my second grade year. I'm now 53years old, but I have thought about my behavior many, many times and I look back on that sweet girl with empathy and heartbreak every time I think of how I treated her. I have since raised 2 (now grown) daughters and cannot think of anyone being mean to them without also remembering how mean I was to Mae. If I could, I would apologize to Mae.

i had a close friend, K, who shared a history class with me. we spent every day together bc we shared multiple classes and went to the same middle school (tho we weren’t friends before freshman year). for the history class, we decided to pair up for a final project. of course, i procrastinated forever while she did her part of the work. 

day the project is due, im skipping classes (it was toward the end of the year so attendance was spotty to track) so i can quickly finish my half bc i told K i’d have it done in time to present. in the meantime, i asked another friend, S, to tell my teacher i was running late to school and i’d be there by x time. S misunderstood and told my teacher i was at school, in another classroom, actively skipping her class/presenting. so now, i was royally fucked and, by proxy, so was K.

i assumed our teacher would let us present another day but, LOL, when i spoke to the teacher about what happened, she said K got an A on her half and i got an F on mine so our combined final grade for the project was a C. K saved my ass while i fucked her over.

K, bless her heart, was so sweet about it and forgave me, but our relationship changed and we were never that close again, could be bc we had dif schedules the next year or the fact that i was obvi a very shitty friend. here i am, almost a decade later, and i still feel guilty and embarrassed about it.

In my country, at that time, there were some croissants that came with 1 pokemon sticker. Everyone had an album and was crazy about collecting them. We would also exchange stickers when we had multiple and everyone wanted to get the really rare ones which were pretty hard to get.

We have a holiday on the 6th of December when kids get sweets & stuff (like a pre-Christmas thing where we believed that St. Nicholas left sweets for us in our shoes), and one colleagues came to school with his album almost full, and a lot of the rare stickers.

Everyone felt like this is not fair, because our parents didn't have money to buy us 100 croissants at once on Saint Nicholas so we can impress other kids and he was so arrogant while showing us the rare stickers and so proud of his collection, laughing at us that we were ""losers"" compared to him.

I got pissed and when we were having sports, I went back to the empty classroom, took his album, placed it in my backpack and quickly returned to the gym. I knew he will not notice this until he got home because it was the last course for the day.

At home, I took away from the album all the new stickers + other ones which I knew he liked and bragged about and wrote messages on every page from his album, stuff like ""bragging is bad"", ""this is like cheating"", ""this is happening because you kept offending us"", ""I hope you learn your lesson"", bla bla bla. I was smart enough to change my handwriting.

I waited for the next day when we had sports and I did the same thing - sneaked into the classroom but put his album in the trashcan (don't know why). He found it and was so upset about it, even if by then, he had coped with the fact that it's lost and had already bought a new one. He asked all of us to show him our writing so he can compare it with the one in his album but nobody ever knew it was me.

I didn't put his stickers into my album all at once. I was coming up with a new one every few days or every week and I remember that another colleague suspected me a bit but he forgot about it shortly after. I tried to play it kind of fair - I did not ask my parents to buy me croissants so I could get new stickers for a very long time, until I finished slowly adding my colleague's stickers into my album. Altough I did what I did, it didn't seem fair to me.

I had been in a kind of bad mood just from being restless and feeling like I didn’t have much to do last night specifically, but still wanted to be at the activity with my friends. I was also feeling pretty isolated socially specifically at the time, so this contributed to my bad mood. On my way home, I started wanting to get my hands on something alcoholic, just to try.

**I am not an alcoholic, I have only drunk alcohol a couple of times in my life, and I am not a big “party animal” kid

It also occurred to me that this would be quite easy for me to do by stealing a can of beer from my grandparents’ fridge, who live with my immediate family, because nobody would notice it would be missing and it would be easy to sneak out. So once I got home, I immediately told my parents I wanted to go back out for a walk to get some fresh air, went downstairs and took a can of beer, and walked outside with the cab tucked into my sweatshirt pocket. I ended up waking along a little nature trail not far from my house as finished the can by the time I was almost back home and threw it away in a trash can on the street. Then I just went home, said I was going to bed, and went upstairs for the night. 

I haven’t told anyone exactly what I did until now, and I feel like I need to get it off my chest.

I still feel conflicted, however, about the fact that I was drinking alcohol underage alone because I was in a bad mood, any one of which sounds to me like a warning sign of irresponsible alcohol consumption.

And after school program is literally school for like an extra hour and 30 min for the kids who need extra help in school. So I we used to go to other classrooms after school so i would steal there erasers from there pencil case in there desk. Then the next day I would go to my classroom and put them in my pencil case and no one would know. Actually I think because in my classroom everyone was collecting erasers and I never grew up with money and I wanted to fit in so I stole a lot of peoples erasers. They used to look cool for some reason 😭,2021-11-10 21:39:18

This was a few weeks before Halloween and I didn’t really have any friends at the time. This group of girls I had hung out with since early elementary school. I didn’t have anyone to spend time with on Halloween and I didn’t want to be alone.

Marie and the others were doing a group costume and would always talk about it right in front of me when I wasn’t included, but that’s fine, whatever. I asked Marie if I could hang out with them on Halloween and she said no because there would be too many people doing the group costume. I didn’t give a crap about the costume so I said, “what if I wore another costume?” Marie replied to me, “no,  you would make us look bad.”

Ouch. I started to cry because I was really sensitive, and I got embarrassed because this was in the cafeteria at lunch and a lot of people were watching. What did my asshole 12 year old self do? I bit her on the shoulder.

I manipulated the shit out of the guidance counselor and vice principal so they didn’t even tell my parents. I ended up telling my parents about it because I felt really guilty. The vice principal of the middle school told me to my face that I have the impulse of a 2 year old and a rage problem.

I think about this incident several times a day, every day. Life moves on and I know that I should move on too, but I can’t because I feel so guilty. Whenever I’m almost happy about anything in life, I think to myself “remember what you did to that girl, you terrible person.” I’ve never told anyone about the guilt that eats away at me to this day, and will for the rest of my life.",2021-11-09 22:45:25

I stole a total of 50 Visa Gift Cards from my step-dad when I was 12,100,qpykm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/qpykm1/i_stole_a_total_of_50_visa_gift_cards_from_my/,18,1636443282.0,"My stepdad's mother owns her own daycare business and has a bit of money laying around. Instead of saving it like a normal person, she will buy 10-20 Visa Gift cards at a time with varying amounts of money and give it to her friends and family for absolutely no reason.

Over the years, my step-dad had collected at least 150 gift cards, which were sitting in one giant pile in his office. Being the ripe age of 12 and having ownership over my very first iPhone, I thought out a plan to take as much money as I could from that pile.

Over the span of a month, I could use one $20 card on songs in the iTunes store or whatever. That was roughly 15 songs a month, and just small enough that my mom wouldn't notice my growing track collection. So, once a month, I'd steal a $20 Visa Card from the pile. When I was done, I'd slide it somewhere in the middle of the pile and hope he'd never notice. And if he did, he'd probably just assume he used it and forgot.

But it didn't stop there.

Eventually, 15 songs a month was too much, as I'd usually obsessively listen to one song for weeks at a time. I started buying full albums, then buying games, then making in-app purchases in those games, such as Candy Crush, the My Little Pony App, Subway Surfers, Words with friends, and *Draw Something*.

Draw Something was my addiction when spending money. There was the option of buying packs of colors and bombs with the in-game coins you'd earn from playing the game. But an impatient 12 year old didn't actually *play* the game enough to buy all the packs. I swear, I had every color pack and an endless supply of bombs to absolutely destroy my friends without actually having to see what they drew in the first place.

Since my step-dad had his own job and felt bad using his mother's money, he rarely looked at the pile of cards unless he was gifting the cards back to his mom. So this ""plan"" was incredibly easy and I never got caught... For 4 years. I haven't actually counted the exact amount of cards I stole, but basic math leads me to an average of 50 cards over the span of 4 years, granted I stuck to the plan.

By the time I was 16, I learned that the transaction history's could be tracked. And I *panicked*. We were moving in the next 2 months, so I took it upon myself to do my step-dad a ""favor"" and go through every. card. Just to see if there were any expired or, oh I don't know, empty ones lol who knows haha...

It's been many years since I used that last card. I still fear that one card slipped past and they'll find my history of hundreds of Draw Something purchases...",2021-11-09 09:34:42
I used to steal books from the public library as a teenager,25,qpx6hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/qpx6hk/i_used_to_steal_books_from_the_public_library_as/,14,1636437446.0,"Looking back, I had seriously sticky fingers as a kid. Although I didn't grow up that poor, my parents were sort of penny pinchers and didn't really believe in buying ""stuff"" if it wasn't necessary. The things I stole were usually books and pencil bags from lost and founds or if I just saw a book sitting out on a counter, etc. Sometimes books from classroom book corners that I wouldn't check out so no one would know they were missing.

I don't know why I would do this and I never got in trouble with my parents because we *did* have a lot of second hand books donated from other family friends' kids who were older. Basically my parents couldn't tell the difference, and if I did have a new-ish book around, I would just say I ""found"" it and that was enough (smh).

Anyway, I think the most severe case of my childhood kleptomania was when I escalated to stealing from the local library. Libraries have sensors, of course, sort of like grocery stores, but at some point as a kid, I realised that there were these silver shiny sticker in the back of library books.

There was a bathroom in the library and since I spent hours at a time at the library (sometimes with my mom and sibling and sometimes on my own having biked over), no one would ever really be keep track of my movements. I had a book bag with me because I checked out a lot of books, so this was also pretty inconspicuous when I would go into the bathroom with a bag of books. 

I would peal the sticker out of the book(s) I wanted to steal (usually, it was one that I'd read previously and decided I wanted to *have* always), and then wrap the sticker up and throw it in the trash. Then I'd just leave the book in my book bag when I was doing self-checkout. I must have stolen like at least 12 books from the public library alone from the age of 10 - 14.

I feel bad about it and I know my mom even returned a few to the library drop-off when she was cleaning my room once (the books are stamped with '\_\_\_\_ public library' of course). I definitely grew out of stealing stuff, mostly because I'm no longer in any kind of school environment anymore. The funny thing is that I never *shoplifted* or stole cash or anything.

And who steals *books* in the first place?? Me, I guess.",2021-11-09 07:57:26

I consistently steal $40- $80 from my one roommate every month and the other roommate I steal weed from.,0,qpjxwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/qpjxwz/i_consistently_steal_40_80_from_my_one_roommate/,33,1636396505.0,"I have a money spend issue so I’m constantly broke. To make up for this I swipe money from my one roommate. I don’t need it. I mostly take it because I can. If it wasn’t there for me to take I’d be perfectly fine. I only ever spend it on weed anyway. 

The other roommate I steal his weed somewhat for the same reason. I smoke a good 400 a month easily but somehow I never have weed. He always has weed and probably spend closer to 100-150 a month on it. So I steal his. Sometimes from under his nose while we smoke together. 

They’ve never noticed or at the very least they’ve never mentioned the missing money or weed. I’d like to think it’s because I’m smart about it and I’ve established a very good persona. 

I’ve also pilfered prescriptions and the random food stuffs from them. I stopped stealing pills tho because they started noticing and one accused the other of stealing them. 

It might be worth mentioning that I harbor a very real feeling of disdain for both of them, borderline hatred really. 

This developed because both like to ramble for hours and are impossible to talk to as they’re extremely self centered and will consistently talk over and interrupt to interject something about themselves.

Comment,2,j0slmyi,,0,1671417068.0,"A few years ago I was at a party and some dude there was absurdly drunk. He kept staring at my tits and was saying how good I look and it was just weird as hell. For one it was a Halloween party and I was dressed as the ""Day Man"" from always sunny. Basically just wearing a yellow suit and white dress shirt. Not even a ""sexy"" costume and had zero cleavage going on. Whatever. I'm kinda just ignoring him cuz he's obviously shit faced. Then he leans in and tries to kiss me and I dodge it. He grabbed at my boobs and I pushed him off. He literally chased me around outside the garage for a minute and I was just dodging him and runnng over towards my friends while yelling at him to knock it off and saying ""no dude, stop."" He literally lurched at me with both hands flying towards my boobs and I just stepped aside and he faceplanted on the ground. My friends were just totally oblivious. I told the party host what happened and he also brushed it off as ""yea that dude is just too drunk."" Didn't confront the guy or kick him out or anything.

I went around and warned every girl I knew that this dude was drunk and assaulted me and that no one was trying to stop him or help me. Fuck that shit. Really ruined my night and I lost so much respect for my friends and the host that did nothing to even try and control this dude or kick him out. Even worse, my husband was at the party with me and he also didn't get how upsetting it was. (we're now divorcing.... Unrelated to this but I should've seen the signs here) 

Had he asked me to kiss him or was just inappropriately talking about my tits... Whatever man. Creepy but forgivable. I can brush that off. You didn't do anything too bad. Just cringey. You weren't grabbing at her or anything. Had I received an apology I would've appreciated it but that dude clearly was not only drunk, but also majorly disrespectful of boundaries completely. Different scenario.

Work on respecting boundaries and I see you're sober so that's a good choice. But you didn't ruin anyone's life. You just acted like an idiot.",2022-12-19 04:31:08

If you choose to not own up to what you’ve done (in other words if you are lacking integrity at this time) I don’t feel as though you should end the friendship- just be better. It sounds as though you’ve learned your lesson, and you seem guilty- so just be a better friend to them, and leave them to their kinks. It’s none of yours business.

Age of consent VARIES from state to state. California has an age of consent of 18 (EIGHTEEN) years of age, just to give an example.

Lack of brains can't be replaced with stubbornness.

From https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/age-of-consent-by-state

California

Age of Consent: 18 Close-in-age Exemption: No

With just under 40 million people, California is the most populous state. Its age of consent is 18, and anyone seventeen or under is considered incapable of consenting to sex in California. So, anyone having sex with a partner under eighteen is theoretically committing a crime. Even if both partners are under eighteen, technically, both can be prosecuted under the state's law.

California's statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under age 18 who is not their spouse. Punishments vary depending on the respective ages of both victim and offender. Separate crimes exist for sodomy with minors and sexual intercourse with a child under age 14 when the attacker is at least seven years older. California has seven statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

Texas

Age of Consent: 17 Close-in-age Exemption: No

Another populous state, the Texas statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under 17. While there is no close-in-age exemption, potential defenses exist when the offender is no more than three years older than the victim and of the opposite sex. Sexual intercourse between an employee of a school and a student is prohibited unless they are married. No age of consent is specified in the special instance of a school employee and student who engaged in sexual intercourse. Texas has five statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

Florida

Age of Consent: 18 Close-in-age Exemption: Yes

As one of the retirement destinations in the U.S., the state is the third most populous, and the age of consent is 18. So, anyone 17 or under is considered incapable of consenting to sex. Florida does have a close-in-age exemption, or Romeo and Julie, law, but it is different. It allows minors aged sixteen or seventeen to engage in consensual sexual intercourse with a partner no older than 23. Florida has four statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

Alabama

Age of Consent: 16 Close-in-age Exemption: Yes

While the age of consent is 16, Alabama's statutory rape law is violated when an individual over the age of 18 engages in sexual intercourse with a person over the age of 12 and under age 16. Or when a person 16 or older engages in sexual intercourse with a victim that is at least two years younger. Additionally, an offender commits the crime of sodomy if an individual age 16 or older engages in deviate sexual intercourse with a person under 16 and older than 12, which is enforced as a statutory charge. Alabama has ten statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

Georgia

Age of Consent: 16 Close-in-age Exemption: No

When a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under the age of 16 who is not their spouse, the Georgia statutory rape law is violated. While no close-in-age exemption exists in Georgia, if the offender is under age nineteen and the victim is no more than four years younger, the offense is classified as a misdemeanor rather than a felony. Georgia has eight statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

New York

Age of Consent: 17 Close-in-age Exemption: No

New York statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under 17, to whom they are not married. Punishment varies depending on the age of the offender. Also, in New York, there is no defense based on a lack of knowledge of the victim's age. New York has 15 statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

Pennsylvania

Age of Consent: 16 or 18 Close-in-age Exemption: Yes

If both parties are under eighteen, Pennsylvania has an age of consent of sixteen years old. Or, if the defendant is eighteen or older, the age of consent is 18. The state's statutory rape law defines the age of consent as 16, and it conflicts with another law; Pennsylvania's corruption of minors statute indicates that the age of consent is 18. This has produced some confusion since the laws allow teens 16 and 17 to consent to each other, but not 18 or older. Teens between 13 and 15 may or may not be able to consent to a partner less than four years older. It is uncertain because while a defendant might not be affected by the statutory rape laws, they could be prosecuted under other offenses. Pennsylvania has six statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

Ohio

Age of Consent: 16 Close-in-age Exemption: Yes

Ohio statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual they are not married to under the age of 16. A close-in-age exemption exists, allowing minors aged 13 and older to consent to a partner under 18. Ohio has five statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.

North Carolina

In North Carolina, the age of consent is 16; however, there are a lot of exceptions to the general rule.

For example, anyone who is employed in an elementary, middle, or high school cannot engage in sexual activity with any student. The only exception would be if the teacher is married to that student.

Engaging in sexual activity with someone under the age of 16 is prohibited by the laws of North Carolina unless the defendant is less than four years older than the other person involved.

I don’t think anyone on Reddit really holds my opinion in high regard, at least I would hope no one would, considering how reckless it would be on anyone’s part to put stock in what some Reddit stranger has to say. 

My opinion is still the same and I have every right to it. As someone who also had my childhood ripped away from me, a victim of abuse, and someone who was not taught healthy coping strategies (sadly this is the majority of people), I don’t go around abusing anyone. So I have very little understanding for people who have less trauma than myself going around bullying others and falling back on a diagnosis to rationalize their abhorrent behavior rather than taking accountability and doing better. 

Not here for the excuses, if someone is that sick that they cannot control their impulses to abuse, then they probably shouldn’t be out in society.

Ps. I’m working towards my PhD in psychology, I study personality disorders for fun as a passion of mine and am very well familiarized with BPD. I’m well aware of their internal struggles and have met/worked with individuals diagnosed with BPD, my opinion is very well-informed.",2022-12-19 02:38:18

Comment,1,j0s06bt,,0,1671407139.0,"Men can absolutely be abused by a woman. They however, cannot be raped as the legal definition of rape is unwanted/non- approved penal to vaginal penetration.  
I need more detail at what exactly he is so embarrassed about? “Dating” a WOMAN that much older did he think she just wanted to play with his legos? As a 16m one would think that sex isn’t a total unknown concept. If he wasn’t ready for it then dating a 20f really wasn’t a good idea. Maybe that is why she would leave often and for long periods of time. 
Was it the sex he was embarrassed about OR the “she put something up me” part. If he enjoyed it or afterwards thinks that (something painful?) is part of regular sex then his confusion and embarrassment is totally understandable. He should talk to a professional about it. Just leave out her age.
Hope he realizes that there is nothing to be embarrassed about and learns that if he communicates what he likes and doesn’t he may be able to relax and enjoy himself.

From 19-22 I dated a 31f who was getting and finalized a divorce. At first I was intimidated by her sexual power and prowess. And embarrassed of my inexperience (I only thought a “tripod” was a camera stand. Silly rabbit I was). After about a month and her being patient, it was the best learning experience of my life. Without knowing this story every girlfriend thereafter has unknowingly thanked her. Beside the sex education I speak fluent shoe, fashion and even cooking. If there was 5 years less of an age differential  we may have given it a real try.",2022-12-19 01:45:39

Comment,1,j0ryyn1,,0,1671406614.0,">As I was trying to go to sleep she started touching my arm and my chest, I asked her to stop but she would just tell me that it was fine. She touched my belly and my butt from there, eventually touched my privates. I pushed her away a few times but really didn't say anything I was just confused.

OP, telling her to stop when she was touching you was the first time you withdrew your consent. The second was when you pushed her away not just once, but a few times. She was 20 years old, she knew, very clearly, that you did not want her to continue, but took advantage of you anyways. 

I am so sorry for how confusing and overwhelming this is for you, especially being a man and knowing that men struggle significantly with admitting when they were assaulted and abused. You do not need to say the word ""no"" for it to be rape, and I am truly heartbroken for you that you've been conditioned to believe that.

I sincerely hope that you are no longer anywhere near this woman and that you have a support system of people you trust, I would very much recommend that you try to open up and be vulnerable with them about what you went through. I also hope that you find a therapist or counselor that can help you navigate the confusion, denial, anger, and pain that you must be going through.

Despite this, you cannot invalidate an entire group. Two wrongs don't make a right. I know it is extremely hard for you and I can't imagine the horrors you were put through. This disorder is caused by abuse. The abuse you suffered was more than likely a reflection of the abusive intrapersonal relationships that person had. In reality, BPD manifests because these individuals had their childhood ripped away from them. People with BPD physically have a brain that is not wired for healthy coping mechanisms. Deep down, there is a child that is starved for validation and love. Many studies show that BPD is the most agonizing and painful mental illness.  
  
Now, this isn't an excuse for being an abuser but it at least explains why they act the way they do. BPD is very manageable when the right treatment is received. Having a diagnosis is NOT an excuse to be abusive. However, you bring yourself down to the level of your abuser by taking your anger out on an entire population. Simply because someone has a disorder that affected you personally, doesn't give you the right to be cruel to others. I wish you the best.

What happened reminds me a lot of when the term ""date rape"" was created. As a nation, we were just becoming more conscious of talking about taboo social situations and understanding them.

The term was created in the 80's after scientific surveys (on sexual experiences) showed a large amount of sexual assaults by a spouse, significant other, date, friend etc. So often rape is not the violent act we see in the news or in TV shows. It is done by those we let in close to us. Those who take advantage of a situation.

In the beginning, only 2% of these attacks were reported. Because most of the victims felt exactly like you do.

I feel like your biggest shame is that you didn't say no.  Look at it like this. In a traumatic event our natural instinct is to freeze, flight, fight. You froze. There is no shame in that. It was your natural biology trying to protect you. 

Traumatic events will affect each person differently.

The best advice I can give you is to work on forgiving yourself. Seek counseling if needed.

Sex and sexuality are weird and just because you ended up enjoying it, you were still forced to go through with it. Instead of focusing on the semantics of how you like sex normally, focusing on the fact that you were *not* DTF at 10 years old is the bigger factor.

You’re not alone, finding out what you like during a forced sexual encounter makes people feel weird and confused about the fact that you didn’t want it to happen.

Comment,3,j0qr3cr,,0,1671388919.0,"“you women” 😳

yikes. my comment was perfectly civil. I was saying that the shitty law enforcement is shitty for EVERYONE. for specifically what the law calls “forced to penetrate”, you’re right that it is absolutely not taken seriously by law enforcement, the law, and popular culture. it’s not considered legally rape, but a form of sexual assault. is it rape? absolutely. 

the thing is, rape impacting women and other genders is not like, better. another kind of SA that was legally not recognized as rape until 1993 is marital rape. In many states there are still provisions that protect abusers who are married to their victims, just like how women who rape men this way also get off lightly (reduced sentences, may not be enforced or face charges). in some states you will go to the police and say you were abused by your spouse, and they will laugh in your face just how some men are laughed at. however, marital rape OVERWHELMINGLY affects women. yet, abusers who are married to their victims, the majority of who are men, also get off lightly and are not punished equally by the law. which just points out that generalizing is not great.

so, it’s unfair any way you put it. like I said, it’s not a competition. You were the one who mentioned your own experiences, yet us merely mentioning ours to point out that it’s not like many people go to jail for rape period, yet alone for sexual coercion is somehow making it about us? your comment said that if it was a man he would be in jail and they would never wonder if it was rape. that’s just not correct and it’s not “awareness of seriousness”.

You can point out that men have distinct and difficult issues being taken seriously for sexual assault without making it a competition with women who are ALSO victims. many of us are not taken seriously for the SAME reasons. your comment honestly shows how you see women, though 😕 I hope you can heal from your trauma and genuinely wish you the best in that journey.",2022-12-18 20:41:59

Comment,1,j0qfpxn,,0,1671384842.0,"Especially with you being m, I’d say it definitely matters. Especially if this was a couple decades ago. I am sorry to say but she did abuse you, and I think at some point you either understood that and tried to shake it off (to where you’re now saying it wasn’t abuse) or it felt easier to say that then needing to try to explain the situation to yourself. The reason why being a male and if it was closer to 90s and behind is that the general reaction would be like ‘woo hoo you got lucky’ or to try to swing this as a positive. Like you said, you were uncomfortable. And even before this, the girl kept dropping you for months at a time. Feelings and emotions are complicated, and you may not have said no but everything you’re describing is that you did not want to do the experience. This is what some girls mean when they ‘didn’t say no’ but still didn’t want it to happen, if this helps clear things up. And it’s more understandable since she knew you liked her, after 2 years of tugging and pulling you emotionally it seems with all the distancing for periods of time. In the moment, especially for someone you like, you’d rather not say no or dismiss anything for fear/worry/anxious of them getting mad or having another negative reaction. You may be cringing about it, but it’s really because it was a tough time for you. Confusing, unsure what to do or say, and you seemingly letting it happen while not wanting it but also not ‘telling’ her to stop is probably giving yourself mixed signals on how to interpret the situation, both back then and now. This is a bit of a good example of showing how a situation isn’t just black and white, like everything, it’s gray (in your perspective of the event; the woman definitely took advantage of you from my understanding). It’s ok if the situation makes you want to cry or break down, you’re not ‘cringing’ at yourself but it’s you trying to process everything. Knowing you didn’t want it but letting it happen anyways, it doesn’t sit right with you and seems to have been in the back of your head for a while. As you said, this dilemma tore you up so much mentally that you had suicidal thoughts because of the entire interaction. Please reconsider, you actually were abused. And I’m not trying to say this with any negative intent towards you. I do wish you the best of luck bud. If your friends tell you to ‘get over it’ all because you got laid, they’re just looking at the situation as a generic fuck while excusing how uncomfortable the experience made you.",2022-12-18 19:34:02

I’m so sorry you experienced that and that you experienced some type of gaslighting by I don’t know who, afterwards. Maybe by society: since a “guy can’t be assaulted by a woman”? It sounds like she was the one who did some serious damage, with no real consequences. I don’t know who gaslit you into thinking what you went through wasn’t a true sexual assault, but they’re wrong, whatever they are. 

You said no, she kept pressuring and pushing and coerced you. If the tables were turned, and you were the 20 yr old guy pressuring his 16 yr old girlfriend to have sex despite her VERBALLY NOT CONSENTING, we wouldn’t question that as a sexual assault.

No one asked. Not the point. She should know better. What kind of 20 year old finds a 16 year old attractive or thinks they would be capable of understanding what is happening on the same level as they do??

We do not dictate all that is right or wrong according to the semantics of a law in the area you live in, that is always relative. The law is for keeping order and for determining what is legal and what is illegal. You can be a dick or abusive without doing something illegal afterall, and there are many laws that have blind spots.

In this case, this person did not consent, was too young to fully understand what was happening, and had an uneven power relationship with the girl in question, who clearly did not treat him seriously or with respect and manipulated them.

Comment,3,j0pzysc,,0,1671378586.0,"You did all that you needed to do in order for her to know that you didn't want it. If she was coercing you it means she didn't get explicit consent. She knew what she was doing and completely disregarded your feelings and boundaries.

You did nothing wrong and I am so sorry that this happened to you. I know all too well how horrible it feels. You are NOT at fault! She is the one who manipulated and raped you while you were still a minor. 

Please, if you haven't already, consider seeing a therapist about this. I went a couple of years thinking it would go away before I realised how much it was still affecting me. 
You say that you didn't explicitly tell her no and therefore it wasn't rape. I used to think the exact same thing. Therapy has tought me that it was, in fact, not my fault. You are not to blame for how your brain and body reacted to this huge violation. It is incredibly shocking to have a person you trust abuse you like this. 

It is never wrong to ask for help. It might be hard to find the right support, and I imagine it is even harder to feel heard and seen as a man, but I hope you listen to all these people who are telling you that you are not at fault! <3  If you need someone to talk to please don't hesitate to message me.",2022-12-18 17:49:46

EMDR essentially pulls those traumas from that file, and with a good therapist, it gets worked through a bit better than restored in the right file. It's not for everyone.

That is sexual assault. You dont need to scream and shout and kick for you to not give consent. You didn't give consent and that is the end of the story.

Comment,2,j0po0qr,,0,1671373002.0,"Being judgemental is a response to fear, natural but not always good. 

In my case, I usually overcome it through exposure to the object of my own negative judgements. Unfortunately, there are such a thing as people with massive barriers and therefore I am at times unable to disprove my own negative judgements towards them because they don't allow it. So it can only get more and more polarized even though I know for a fact that my negative preconceptions are likely false, I can't prove them to be false because nobody will let me in. So I get it, you can only give what you get. If judgement is all you ever get from anyone, that's all you're expected to give back to anybody. 

But I still think you're wrong.",2022-12-18 16:16:42

Comment,10,j0pntu0,,0,1671372899.0,"Aw. Okay so men have been told all too often that they aren’t raped because blah blah blah. Or whatever the fuck dumbass people say these days. Sweetheart, I’m so sorry. You were raped. 

Not only was this statutory rape: someone over 18 having sex with a minor, but this was also straight up rape. You pushed her away. You never said yes. You were very incredibly clear about not wanting to be in that situation. 

You do not actually have to say NO in order for the message to be clear. 

The only time consent is ever given is when you say yes. Otherwise, it is non consensual. If there is obvious rejection, literally saying no, saying “I don’t want to” then being convinced by them asking a bunch of times, it’s all rape. 

I am so sorry you went through this, but you did not lie. You were abused. And I know people have probably gaslit you into thinking you were just an embarrassed teen and that you didn’t say no so blah blah. But they’re stupid. And wrong.

Comment,1,j0pmyxu,,0,1671372432.0,"Imagine reading all of this, removing literally 2 lines, and conclude that all of this is blaming the victim instead of trying to focus on their mental health, their future and all it still has to offer, and how even forgiveness (as insurmountable and impossible as it might at many points seem) might be on of the most powerful tools at their disposal and decide I’m blaming the victim. I tried to thread as careful as possible and someone, somehow, still manages to asume I’m trying to make someone’s day _worse_.

Jesus Christ, some people will do whatever it takes to be offended. Including intentionally cherry picking lines.

OP, my suggestion to you is to find a peaceable person or professional and ask them how you can come to terms with the mistake. Crazy as this sounds, if you can find a licensed hypnotherapist, they are amazing and I actually prefer them over counselors. Who wants to relive upsetting things from the past every time you speak with a therapist?  Hypnotherapists give you tools to change some thoughts. 

A suggestion - every time this memory enters your mind, tell yourself “That’s not productive” and move on.  Or “that doesn’t help you”. Whatever the phrase you choose. Because it isn’t. It’s done.

Victim blaming at its finest. Going through abuse is a major trauma. No one is obligated to forgive anyone and sometimes things are hard to move past. It's very easy for someone who has never been abused to say ""just get over it"", when you don't have to deal with a lifetime of emotional and mental torment brought on by people you trusted.

Comment,122,j0oynhw,,0,1671354589.0,"You were groomed and raped. Even if you liked her she knew better as an adult. I don't care if she was 18 and a new adult she still knew you were a minor. Then you said when you told her to stop touching you and she said it was fine, thats when you withdrew your consent. At that point anything she did was pressuring you and coercing you into sex which is not consent. Even if you verbally consented after that point if she guilted or pressured you into contenting verbally it wasn't true consent. Then there was the nonconseual penetration which is another thing she should have gotten clear consent for.
 
You were abused and you likely still have trauma from this. The being in denial and gaslighting yourself into believing it isn't trauma and abuse is because when you told people about what happened to you no one else treated it like a problem. Grooming is a sneaky form of abuse and can often lead to this result: the victim blaming themselves or pretending like it wasn't actually wrong or real. 

Consent is very important when I comes to intimacy of any kind. From children and parents interacting to friends and especially with relationships. If you feel uncomfortable with something it is the other person's responsibility to respect that. Just as if your partner is uncomfortable with something it is your responsibility to respect their boundaries.",2022-12-18 11:09:49

I just want you to know you didn't lie, she abused you in one of the worst ways someone can. Just because you didn't tell her to stop doesn't mean you ever consented to it, if she had more than two brain cells she would've realized you were uncomfortable and not ready for that. Beyond being a rapist, she's a child predator, you were a child and she was an adult that took advantage. Even if you ejaculated that's your body's natural response, that doesn't mean you enjoyed it or wanted it. She's disgusting and I'm sorry she did that to you. I strongly recommend therapy to help you work through your feelings about this. I'm wishing peace and healing upon you.",2022-12-18 09:52:19

Comment,12,j0oq66j,,0,1671347799.0,"A very similar thing happened to me when I was 16. I was in my first sexual relationship, it was the 20 year old security guard at my uncle's place. I also thought he was the most handsome beautiful man I had ever seen and I met him when I was 15. I also was ghosted by him, he would walk by me without a smile and only treat me with affection in private. The last time I was with him he pulled my pants down, I rejected him twice and felt weird and uncomfortable, just like you. Eventually I let him do what he wanted and I stopped caring and I didn't say no. It ended up in anal sex, so I guess I was still a virgin afterwards. Anyways just like you I felt disconnected from life and went around telling people I was abused, that I was raped. He got fired and sent back to his country. Later I felt so incredibly guilty for ruining his reputation and making him lose his job because I was a moody teenager. I don't know if we were raped but what I do know is that we have to let it go and stop thinking about that person from our past. The past is the past.

Finding out the genitals that another person has is not a good reason, or emotional conclusion, for sexual manipulation/assault.

Guy came back and said I owed 1800 total with only 1350 taken off from the deposit. I was utterly pissed. I called him and he said the place was filthy, the floors were wrecked, nothing was cleaned. I asked 1800 worth??? I sadly didn't take pictures like an idiot. He always seemed nice but he flipped so fast. 

The thing was, it was only $450, but I could not afford it. I didn't have that kind of money. I didn't have anyone to borrow it from. After trying to talk to him rationally, I told him straight up I do not have the funds. So if he takes me to court, it's going to take a long while to see that money. He asked couldn't I just borrow it from someone? Pssshhh. From who? I think because I was a college student he expected my parents would swoop in. 

He responded by getting even meaner and I don't do well with conflict, so I just broke out in tears. I wasn't actually scared, it's just a stress response for me. He got dead silent and hung up the phone.

Comment,2,j0ogmxa,,0,1671341233.0,"Firstly, your safety is the most important thing here. You cant control anyone other than yourself. I can highly recommend the therapy app TalkSpace. Self-harm thoughts are an indication that your stress is well  beyond your healthy threshold for stress/triggers so your options for being around your brother &/or mental health support is first priority. 

Secondarily, your brother may have an undiagnosed imbalance, which could be anything from a mental disorder to a repressed trauma. Maybe hes just pushing the boundaries to be an ahole, Im not a Dr,  but the fact is that if he has some treatable problem & hes being rejected by everyone around him in response to his behavior it will most likely get worse & that doesn't need to happen. Its not on you ti fix the situation, thats on him & whoever is responsible for his well-being. Maybe suggesting it as something to look into could help?

Im sorry youre going thru that, you deserve to feel safe around your family. Put yourself first & whatever that means for you may not be easy but its worth it. You dont have to lose your life to this.",2022-12-18 07:27:13

That’s a very real possibility. Is the anxiety worth it? I also would rather tell my parents I’m sexually active than having to tell them I’m pregnant at such a young age. If you trust your bf’s mom more then you could maybe tell her first. I got pregnant while on the pill, but that’s a better chance of not than just using condoms. It doesn’t matter what your parents did at a young age, they’ll want better for you because I’m sure they have regrets from what they’ve done. Please tell someone.

That being said, there's no reason to tell your parents unless you need help getting out of a manipulative relationship (or if your boyfriend is significantly older than you).  I know you're worried about going on the pill, but I do hope you are using some form of birth control because if you're scared to tell your parents you're having sex, imagine how much harder it will be to tell them you're pregnant.

Comment,4,j0o7vrw,,0,1671336332.0,"Mistakes will be made.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  It sounds like you received slight consequence and mostly a hit on your pride.  Clerk cut you a break and noe you've made a connection.  Come back in and buy a freaking box next time she is working.  Laugh it off together. 

What did it make you feel like in the moments leading to and just after slipping them into your control? I (51M) think shoplifting was my first addiction.  I think this is key to why we do what we're do.  Be mindful. 

I still question the concept of ownership, the ethics and morality of needs vs. sanctions,  and it's instinctual for me to rather have that hit of endorphins than respect society's arbitrary constricts.  I'm owed.  Early on I was brought up on a commune Etc. Etc and so forth.

I haven't shoplifted in decades. The hassle of getting caught as an adult isn't worth it and I have a bit more respect for everyone involved.  And in the end The-Worker-as-Consumer is harmed by increased prices and decreased access.  Silly things are being locked up.  

This idea of only stealing from large corporations is noble on the surface but it's baloney.  It violates right effort if nothing else.  And large corporations can afford to stick it to the consumer (and the Worker) using shoplifting as the cause. I assume I'm being watched anywhere retail.  Baby, I'm a star! 

Modern day boosters also sort of ruined it for the casual klepto.

Before I was old enough to buy alcohol, I was an overnight clerk at 7-11. Training was to not intervene and then call the police to report the crime.  Cops would show up hours later.  IDGAF.  Honestly it was mostly diapers & formula being stolen and rarely.  


If it was me working that night, I would have said something sarcastic on your way out like ""don't forget the rest"".  Or ""smile for the camera"".
